He has a $5.1 billion fortune, owns a pretty kick-ass private island, an airline, a space exploration company, and he hob nobs with everyone from the <a href=# title="Dalai Lama Net Worth">Dalai Lama</a> to <a href=# title="Eddie Vedder Net Worth">Eddie Vedder</a>. He dropped out of school at 16, and a few years later, started selling records by mail order. He earned his first million by the age of 23. They say it's good to be King, but I think they got that wrong. It is good to be Richard Branson. That man has made it, by all conceivable measurements. His Virgin Group brings in more than $21 billion a year in global revenue. However, it turns out that Branson is not all that comfortable with lavish displays of wealth—and largely tries to avoid them.</p><p>Sure, Branson has, on occasion, spent money indulgently, but as a rule, only to make money in return. Branson considers himself to be pretty frugal and has chosen not to own objects of pure luxury. He's also a major philanthropist and member of the Giving Pledge. Let's take a look at how the daredevil billionaire spends his fortune.</p><p>A high school teacher famously told Branson that he'd either be a multi millionaire or end up in jail.</p><p>He launched Virgin Records in 1972. The Virgin Group conglomerate grew out of this.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-270555 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-808634794.jpg alt width=900 height=605 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-270555 class=wp-caption-text>Scott Barbour/Getty Images</p><p>Branson grew up in middle class, which has helped him remain frugal even as he amassed his multi-billion dollar fortune. Back in 2002, during an interview with The Guardian, Branson said:</p><p>"The idea of having a possession that is there just as pure luxury and is not actually paying its bills is something which I'd be embarrassed about."</p><p>That said, Branson has made a number of splashy purchases, but they are usually more of an investment than an indulgence. For example, Branson bought his private Necker Island in 1978 for $180,000. In 1983, he spent $10 million building the resort on the island that doubles as his home. In 2006, the value of the island was $60 million. That's a 33,233% increase in 28 years. Branson has called this the best financial move of his life.</p><p>Necker Island isn't Branson's only luxury real estate holdings. He also owns Son Bunyola in northwest Mallorca, which is an estate with three villas for guests. He also owns a ski resort in the Swiss Alps called The Lodge. Rooms start at $945 per night. If you want to book the whole lodge for a week in winter, that will run you $89,916. Branson also owns properties in Cape Town, South Africa and Morocco.</p><p>Branson owns Mahali Mzuri, a safari camp in the Maasai Nara National Reserve in Kenya. The tented camp has a 40-foot infinity pool. Tents are $590 a night. He has a fourth property in Africa, Ulusaba, which is in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve.</p><p>Before he moved to Necker Island, he owned homes in London. It isn't known how much he paid for his Oxfordshire mansion, but he sold it to his kids for $1.78 million. He also had a home in London's Holland Park that he bought for $3.3 million and listed much later for $23.12 million.</p><p>Another thing you won't find in Branson's homes and properties—expensive artwork. He prefers to buy art he likes—usually watercolors—at reasonable prices.</p><p>Branson owns a refurbished houseboat in London. He bought it for $2,600. It can be rented for about $1,000 a week. He has said that he never plans to sell it.</p><p>Branson does own a private plane. His Falcon 50EX cost $21 million new. He also drives a Range Rover, but it is gifted to him each year from the manufacturer.</p><p>As mentioned Branson is also a big philanthropist. He is a member of the Giving Pledge and has vowed to give away more than half of his fortune in his lifetime. He spends 80% of his time working with Virgin Unite, the charitable arm of the Virgin Group. He has pledged $3 billion over 10 years to develop low carbon fuel and stop or slow climate change.</p><p>But Branson's biggest luxury is one many of us can attain—being your own boss.</p><p>"If we're talking about personal luxuries — and the luxury of being your own boss — the biggest reward is the amount of time one can find for family and friends."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfp7aktMCrm2aaopa7tLvNZqCsZZ%2Bjsm67xWaroZ1dp7aktMSsq2aolaS9rbGMoqVmrJiaeri70aWbZpqlqXqprdOeqmafkae2tLSMnaCsqJyWxrR5zp9ksJ2RocGpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
