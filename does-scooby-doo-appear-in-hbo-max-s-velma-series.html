As the hype surrounding Velma reaches an all-time high, people have questions about whether or not an animated version of Scooby-Doo will be making an appearance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Viewers who are hopeful about seeing Scooby-Doo getting pulled into silly shenanigans with the rest of his squad are in for a little bit of disappointment. Unfortunately, Scooby won’t be appearing in the show along with the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Rant</a>, the new Velma show is a little too dark to include Scooby since he’s such a kid-friendly character.</p><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=942 data-injectable=true>Scooby has an innocence and playfulness about him that simply doesn’t fit into what the creators of Velma were trying to accomplish. During a New York Comic Con panel via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, the creators opened up about their decision to write Scooby out entirely. They explained, “When we were going into the show, and thinking about adapting it, we wanted to be respectful. We didn’t want to just kind of take these beloved characters and put them in outrageous or gross situations, and say like, ‘Isn’t it crazy we did that to Velma?'”</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Keeping Scooby out of the show means that it can be thought of as a show geared at more mature audiences. The showrunners even took it as far as to forbid any expression of the name Scooby Doo in the show altogether.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Will there be another movie or show that includes Scooby-Doo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/scooby.jpeg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Since Scooby isn’t part of Velma, it makes sense that people would be curious to know if the beloved character will show up in any future projects in animated or CGI form. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Movie Web</a>, a sequel to 2004’s Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, starring real-life actors and actresses such as Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Junior, isn’t in the works.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=false>Rumors about Scooby-Doo 3 made their rounds over the years, but it’s simply never going to happen. The reason why? The live-action sequel that premiered in 2004 (following the 2002 original) earned significantly less money at the box office than the first one did. But this doesn’t mean a future project including Scooby is off the table forever, there just isn’t any word on that just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZKybn6SvunnDqKZmmaClsqK%2BjKKlZqCSpHqurdesZK%2BdnKKubr%2FEq6Ceq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
