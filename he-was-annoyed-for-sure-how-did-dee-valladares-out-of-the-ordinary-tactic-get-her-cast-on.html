I’m just going to post my audition video on Instagram,'” Dee shared with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;before diving into how she managed to grasp the attention of&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;casting producer Jesse Tannenbaum.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>After posting her audition tape on Instagram, where she has amassed 13.8k followers, the Cuba native said that she encouraged all of her family, friends, acquaintances, ex-boyfriends, and more to comment on the video, tagging Tannenbaum (who happened to be on vacation in Hawaii at the time).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 data-characters=614 data-current-count=906 data-injectable=true>Amassing hundreds of comments on the post, Tannenbaum himself then weighed in on Dee’s controversial choice to post her audition video on Instagram (as well as excessively tag him in the comment section): “I don’t turn my phone on silent, just in case there’s a family emergency, so I remember trying to go to bed one night hearing&nbsp;ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. She had asked everyone that follows her, and their friends who follow them, and their friends that follow&nbsp;them,&nbsp;to tag Jesse Tannenbaum, and I was just like, ‘Oh my God, I hate her.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dee-Valladares-2.png><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>While it may not have been the most innovative approach, spamming Jesse Tannenbaum worked out in her favor in the end!</p><p data-characters=144 data-current-count=144 data-injectable=false>Dee caught the attention of the casting team just 24 hours later, but contrary to popular belief, it was not to offer her a follow-up interview.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 data-characters=291 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>The entrepreneur explained, “The very next day, I get a call from a casting person, and she’s like, ‘Hey, I need you to take down that video.

That means he saw it, right?'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>While she took down the video (per Tannenbaum’s wishes), this interaction kickstarted “a playful love-hate relationship” between the duo, resulting in a series of follow-up interviews with him and longtime host and executive producer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Probst</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 data-characters=403 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>After his first interview with Dee, Probst’s notes were as follows: “LOVE HER! So engaging and bright. Instantly likable out of the gate. She’s funny. She is super likable. I love her, love her, love her. She really listens. She picks up on every cue. She’s very tight with her family. She knew she would be an entrepreneur. I see her on the show. Great winner.
