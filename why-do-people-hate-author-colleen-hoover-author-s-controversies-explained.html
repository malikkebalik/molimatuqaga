Recommended Videos Colleen Hoover‚Äôs name has been a mainstay on BookTok for what feels like years, which is unsurprising considering the author has published more than 20 books and counting.
But aside from the author‚Äôs recent success, the author has received a fair amount of backlash, not just for her writing.

Around 2019-2020, the author received notoriety on TikTok, especially for the 2016 novel,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It Ends With Us</a> (which is now being turned into a film adaptation). The book is a romance novel, but readers were confronted with domestic abuse within the story and how the protagonist managed to fight her way out of it.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>This form of writing became somewhat of a double-edged sword for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoover</a> because fans praised how she wrote it, but also criticized her for adding abuse to her adult-fiction romance novels. At the same time, the author was accused of ‚Äúromanticizing domestic abuse‚Äù in her writing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is a real line in a ROMANCE novel by colleen hoover. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EsU01JVp52</a></p>‚Äî whitney atkinson (@whittynovels) <a href=#>December 27, 2016</a></figure><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>It Ends With Us&nbsp;isn‚Äôt the only book that has faced criticism. Other novels, like&nbsp;November 9, have similar themes. Some characters use physical force and manipulation in order to get their partners to stay, or how certain characters easily forgive those with problematic traits. While It Ends With Us at least recognizes the severity of these types of situations, November 9 seems to romanticize toxicity in relationships which is completely unacceptable.</p><p data-characters=135 data-current-count=135 data-injectable=false>While some argue that it‚Äôs just fiction, others believe that some of these books just don‚Äôt portray healthy relationships.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Another issue is that since the author gained popularity thanks to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>, critics fear that Hoover‚Äôs writing might be harmful to a younger audience who might come across the author thanks to readers‚Äô recommendations through the app.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Allegations against Hoover‚Äôs son, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>her son also sexually harassed me and she aired me and blocked me when i spoke up about it to her üò©</p>‚Äî thowing up over TBNE (@theonottlovebot) <a href=#>February 12, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>In addition to the criticisms of her writing, it was revealed around last year that Hoover‚Äôs son, Levi, was accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. Given the severity of the allegations, many took to social media to ask Hoover to address them.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=true>According to a statement published to Hoover‚Äôs Facebook, she claimed that the two had never met. At the same time, she said that she made her son take accountability for his actions after the victim reached out to the author.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Her son‚Äôs allegations caused a divide amongst her fans. Some sided with her when the rumor started gaining traction, claiming that the victim never spoke anything about the allegations made after Hoover reached out to her. Meanwhile, others claimed that the author was only defending her son.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The It Ends With Us coloring book controversy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Best-selling author <a href=#>@colleenhoover</a> announced a coloring book for It Ends With Us, a novel about domestic violence‚Äîand quickly came out with a statement saying she‚Äôs asked the publisher to no longer move forward with the project.<a href=#>https://t.co/MhRmFcFsQL</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/d0BfnRcIKX</a></p>‚Äî Catcall (@Catcall_Mag) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>The controversy surrounding the author didn‚Äôt end there. It was announced late last year that a coloring book based on It Ends With Us would be released sometime in 2023. This announcement caused a fresh wave of backlash, calling the author ‚Äútone deaf‚Äù because of the book‚Äôs themes.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Having a coloring book based on a book that is centered around domestic violence is incredibly strange. It does not come as a surprise that so much criticism came to the surface after it was announced, and it is unclear how this idea was ever cleared in the first place.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Hoover was made aware of the criticism and took accountability for her actions via a statement on social media. She said that the book was going to focus on ‚ÄúLily‚Äôs strength in mind‚Äù but didn‚Äôt realize how a coloring book based on a story containing violence isn‚Äôt appropriate. She apologized and said that she wouldn‚Äôt be moving forward with the book‚Äôs release.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>, nearly 3 in 10 women and 1 in 10 men have experienced ‚Äúrape, physical violence, and/or stalking‚Äù and domestic violence affects more than 12 million people every year. Hoover‚Äôs writing is heavy and sometimes seen as problematic.</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>With the production of It Ends With Us, critics fear that the film would romanticize domestic abuse, rather than let the audience be aware of how dangerous this is.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>If you are experiencing domestic abuse, or if you believe someone you know is being abused, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>.
