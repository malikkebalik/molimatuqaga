A-Rod purchased the home back in 2014 from none other than Meryl Streep, for about $4.8 million, so if the house sells for its asking price, he'll be making a decent profit in the bargain. As for the house itself, it's a pretty cool architectural specimen, known as the Honnold & Rex Research House."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In other words, it was beyond the cutting edge back then, and still maintains its cool, unusual vibe now. Inside its two stories, it boasts luxuries like a floor-to-ceiling fireplace, a fully equipped chef's kitchen, and a pool and spa in the backyard. As the house listing on YouTube puts it:</p><p><strong>"Architectural Perfection Achieved. Located on the most desirable street above Sunset Plaza, this modern, state-of-the-art estate features exquisite quality of fixtures and furnishings. Massive walls of glass open to a serene courtyard with tranquil pool & spa, creating the perfect union of indoor-outdoor living."</strong></p><p>A-Rod reportedly purchased a new high-rise condo with J-Lo in Manhattan earlier this year for more than $15 million, so his new living situation is all set in advance.</p><p>If you're in the market for "Architectural Perfection," or you just want to live in the house where A-Rod used to live, you'll have to somehow be connected enough to make an offer in the first place ("Shown by appointment only to pre-qualified clients. No open houses. No exceptions.") But in the meantime, or if you just want to do a little online fantasy shopping, you can take a look at the house in the video below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeRobK5edGom6uhl6qyu3nLoqqtq12dvK242LCmqJxdnbatuNJmn6illWKzsL6Mb2RuZZ2eua21zqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
