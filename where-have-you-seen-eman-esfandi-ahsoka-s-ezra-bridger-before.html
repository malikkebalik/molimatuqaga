Recommended Videos Let’s be honest here — Ezra was always a charming little blue-haired cutie, but his official live-action debut shifts him from the bold, earnest Padawan we knew in Rebels to a more mature, measured version of the character. We still know almost nothing about what transpired in the time he was exiled or what comes next for Ezra and Sabine, but we do know that Eman Esfandi was a perfect casting choice."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s part of one of the media’s biggest franchises now, and his star is destined for great heights. It’s likely that Esfandi’s face isn’t overly familiar to most Ahsoka viewers, but the Star Wars project isn’t his first appearance in a major release. It’s just his most prominent.</p><h2 id=h-eman-esfandi-movies-and-tv-shows data-injectable=false>Eman Esfandi movies and TV shows</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Ahsoka will <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">almost certainly be the project</a>, when looked back on in future years, that launched Esfandi’s career.

He did appear in 2018’s Red 11 from Robert Rodriguez, but it wasn’t until 2021’s King Richard that Esfandi truly broke into the mainstream. His future is certainly bright, if his performance as Ezra so far is any indication, leaving Star Wars fans to watch this newcomer’s career with bated breath.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnmShmaaaerq71Gaqnp2eYrKurc1mnKyekaOxqnnAoaqoo5GoeqbG0Zpkm6qZmbSmvoybnJ%2Bnopp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
