Born in London, England, Emms started his current production company, Easter Road Films LLC, in 2019 and has worked with big names like John Legend, Stevie Wonder, Tony Bennett, and Dua Lipa throughout his career. Through his production work, he’s also worked with some massive entertainment companies like Spotify, YouTube, Lionsgate, and 20th Century Fox.</p><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>Notably, Emms was an executive producer on the Netflix documentary series Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives, directed by Chris Smith (known for Tiger King). The true crime series tells the story of vegan restaurateur Sarma Melngailis, the former owner of the New York restaurant Pure Food and Wine. Melngailis met a conman named Anthony Strangis, who was going by the name Shane Fox, and the two married. Things quickly went south for Melngailis as Fox coerced her into stealing nearly $2 million from her restaurant and staff, leading to a life on the run and the couple’s eventual arrest.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Yahoo! News</a>, Emms said he had known Melngailis for over 15 years, and was inspired to create his first documentary after she shared her story with him. He found the story “shocking and cruel” but felt the story was important to share with an audience.</p><p>“It was the most bizarre and surreal story I’d ever heard and I had to try and make sense of it. How and why did this nightmare happen to someone like Sarma?”</p><p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>Emms and Thorne seem head over heels and we wish them a happy engagement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SvprjLmmStoJ%2Bnu6Z5xKeemp%2BVorKvwIywn6hlmah6o7HLpZhmrJikv6%2Bx0madopmemLJuucCromadnaLAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
