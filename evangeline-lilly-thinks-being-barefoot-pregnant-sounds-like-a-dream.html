Yeah, I know … another Hobbit movie. Apologies to all the Middle-Earth fans out there, but this franchise befuddles me.</p><p>Evangeline apparently styled herself for the shoot, which you can see <a href=#>here</a>. That’s kinda cool, but Evangelina was smug about this accomplishment: “I don’t want to just model. Anyone can do that.” She chose some Chanel, Julien MacDonald, and Zuhair Murad ensembles for the editorial. Evangeline did fine, but she shouldn’t quit her Hobbit job. This interview is more interesting than the shoot:</p><p><strong>Her “androgynous” fashion sense:</strong> “I haven’t even scratched the surface of fashion yet. If you are not a clearly defined human being, it is very hard to define your image. And, it is such a difficult thing to navigate. What I’ve realized in my own journey in fashion is that I’m not that defined. I do feel like I am at ease in my own skin when I find an androgynous balance. It’s one of the things I love about my new haircut! I found the balance between masculine and feminine that I am always striving for and never getting.”</p><p><strong>On The Lost curse:</strong> “I was more off the rails than anyone else in the cast. The public didn’t see it but I managed to hold it together by the skin of my teeth.”</p><p><strong>Her dream role:</strong> “It would be amazing to play Sylvia Plath. She was so dark and what came out of her writing was troubled and fierce. The dimensions, levels, layers and levels would be incredible to take on. Let’s face it, the more groundbreaking female writers with families were the original mommy bloggers.”</p><p><strong>Her place in Hollywood:</strong> “I am an opportunist. When opportunities come and I see them serving my grander goals in life, I take them. When I look ahead and see where I want to be in five years from now, I know acting can get me there. It’s a vehicle where I can realize my other dreams.”</p><p><strong>She wants 6 children:</strong> “There is that old mentality where some think women should be barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen. When I hear those words, I think, ‘What. A. Dream.'”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Fashion</a>]</p><p>So Sylvia Plath was one of “the original mommy bloggers“? Oh boy. Somehow I can’t see Sylvia taking the time to Pinterest or bother with any form of social media. She’d probably turn the comments off on a blog, and unlist it with all search engines. Her only online presence would be a Tumblr devoted to the douchey acts of Ted Hughes. I can actually see that part happening. Evangeline should have used a better example to illustrate a mommy blogger.</p><p>As for Evangeline’s desire to be “barefoot and pregnant,” eh, why not? At least she admits the practice is archaic. If that’s what she wants, go for it.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FFN_KM_TheHobbit_072614_51487774.jpg alt="Evangeline Lilly" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fashion mag, Fame/Flynet & WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbHFmbINze8SvmKeflaG2r7G%2BpaClpKmUwam1zaSqmJqVnruoq8GaqZ6en6TBoLzRnp6nmZ6prLS71KebrJecnrimq8CYm6udkaJ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
