The guitarist spoke exclusively with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> of women, the ’70s, and the life he led during that wild and beautiful ride:</p><p>“It was a real, sexually liberated time, the ’70s, there’s never been anything quite like it, honestly. It was just a wild, wild time, and women were truly, truly liberated there for a minute. I mean, it was a really wonderful time to be alive. So, you know, ménages à trois [were] not that unusual.”</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>Falling in love with his wife of almost 39 years, Maureen, brought an end to Van Zandt’s polyamorous stint, however.

Among other insights, Van Zandt explained that he was slated to play Tony Soprano originally, until HBO stepped in and pulled the plug on the idea. Luckily, Van Zandt said he felt legend James Gandolfini’s casting was “the right thing” for the role, “thank goodness.”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The iconic guitarist-turned-actor most recently had acting roles in The Christmas Chronicles and The Irishman.
