For example, earlier this year, Future tweeted out, "This b***h got control problems … I gotta go through lawyers to see baby future … the f***ery for 15k a month." In addition, the songstress called out the Atlanta native for his comments regarding a photo of Ciara's now husband Russell Wilson pushing a stroller with Future's son in it. Future said the following regarding the photo, "She probably set him [Russell] up. You letting them catch that photo. Leave my son out of all the publicity stunts."</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295262 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/c2.jpg alt width=900 height=1324 sizes="(max-width: 1718px) 100vw, 1718px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295262 class=wp-caption-text>Larry Busacca/Getty Images</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ciara launched the lawsuit because she believed that Future's comments were made with malicious intent. Fast forward to today, and more has come out regarding the trash talking between the two parties. According to new legal documents acquired by TMZ, Ciara claims that Future's negative comments made an international cosmetics company flake on giving her an opportunity that likely would have paid the singer $500,000. Despite Russell Wilson's hefty contract with the Seahawks, a half-million dollars is clearly nothing to sneeze at. Ciara claims that Future's negative comments about her, painting her as a "controlling, dishonest, unreasonable, evil, conniving" person made that cosmetic company look the other way.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This is clearly just the beginning of a messy lawsuit.
