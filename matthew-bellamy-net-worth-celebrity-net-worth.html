From a very young age, he showed interest in music, largely influenced by his father, George Bellamy, who was a rhythm guitarist for the 1960s pop group The Tornados. His parents' divorce when he was a teenager heavily influenced his songwriting, contributing to the dark and introspective themes often present in Muse's music.</p><h2 id=muse><strong>Muse</strong></h2><p>In 1994, while attending Teignmouth Community College, Bellamy formed the band Muse with school friends <a href=# title="Dominic Howard Net Worth">Dominic Howard</a> and Chris Wolstenholme. Initially called Rocket Baby Dolls, the trio won a local battle of the bands competition, prompting them to take their musical ambitions seriously. They renamed the band Muse and began working on their unique sound, a blend of rock, classical, and electronic music.</p><p>Muse gained significant popularity in the UK with their first two albums, "Showbiz" (1999) and "Origin of Symmetry" (2001). However, it was their third album, "Absolution" (2003), that catapulted them to international fame, with hits such as "Time is Running Out" and "Hysteria". Bellamy's unique vocal range, intricate guitar work, and profound lyrics played a huge role in defining Muse's sound and setting them apart from other rock bands of their era.</p><p>Always unafraid to experiment, Bellamy and Muse continued to push boundaries in their music. "Black Holes and Revelations" (2006) saw the band incorporating elements of electronic music and progressive rock, while "The Resistance" (2009) had symphonic influences, best exemplified by the three-part "Exogenesis: Symphony". Bellamy's interests in global politics, science fiction, and conspiracies greatly influenced the themes and concepts of these albums.</p><p>Muse's later albums, "The 2nd Law" (2012), "Drones" (2015), and "Simulation Theory" (2018), have further solidified their position in the music industry. "Drones", a concept album about warfare and lost humanity, won the Grammy for Best Rock Album in 2016. Despite evolving their sound over the years, Bellamy's signature high-pitched vocals, dynamic guitar skills, and thought-provoking songwriting remain consistent features of Muse's music.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200616 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Matthew-Bellamy.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200616 class=wp-caption-text>Buda Mendes/Getty Images</p><h2 id=personal-life-real-estate><strong>Personal Life and Real Estate</strong></h2><p>He became engaged to actress <a href=# title="Kate Hudson Net Worth">Kate Hudson</a> in 2011 after dating for a year.
