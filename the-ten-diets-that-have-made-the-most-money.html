Diets are supposed to help people lose weight, which gets them into better shape and helps them feel better both physically and emotionally. One thing you may not be aware of, is just how much money is&nbsp;generated by&nbsp;the diet industry. Some of the most popular diets can end up bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars to the doctors or companies behind them.</p><p>You may be very surprised to learn that the weight loss industry in the United States makes <strong>$60 billion</strong> each year! Add that to $7 billion in Canada and $3 billion in Great Britain, and the industry is one of the most lucrative imaginable.
