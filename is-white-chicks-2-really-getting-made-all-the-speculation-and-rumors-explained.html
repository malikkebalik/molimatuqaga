With the movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still a hit with viewers today on streaming</a>, there’s certainly a market for it.</p><h2 id=h-so-is-white-chicks-2-getting-made data-injectable=false>So, is ‘White Chicks 2’ getting made?</h2><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>The answer is a little complicated. Marlon Wayans, who played Kevin/Brittany and served as a co-writer for the original film, has publicly supported the idea of a sequel. He does, however, have one condition – if he doesn’t have to go through the ordeal of the prosthetic makeup application again, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and gets to wear makeup digitally</a>.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Back in 2019, actor Terry Crews, who played Latrell, stated that a sequel was indeed in the works. Four years on, the movie seems to be nowhere in sight. In 2022, Wayans said that Crews was not meant to announce the sequel, as development was still in its infancy.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>“My face when&nbsp;@terrycrews&nbsp;tells the world&nbsp;#whitechicks2&nbsp;is happening but we still don’t have a deal in place…&nbsp;” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayans wrote on Instagram</a>. “Um… NO! Not yet. #ohterry.”</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=173 data-injectable=false>If demand stays strong, a ‘White Chicks 2’ could certainly happen, but it has yet to be officially announced. For now, any posters you see online are 100% fake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlp522tbGMnJ%2Bim5uoenN50Z6YpaSpYrSmwNOipaBlnZaxpnnApaNmrJiaerS8xJyspZmknryvecCnm2aqpaK8s7%2BMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
