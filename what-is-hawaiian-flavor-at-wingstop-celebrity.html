You can get your classic buffalo sauce, spicy BBQ, teriyaki, or even lemon pepper.

You can also try choosing the flavor based on your zodiac.</p><h2>What is the flavor of Wingstop?</h2><p><strong>Hot Lemon.</strong> Laura Grier/Mashed. If there is a divisive flavor among the Wingstop lineup, it is<strong> Hot Lemon.</strong> Those who believe that citrus and spice go together, and regularly order stuff like jalapeno Hamachi crudo or chili pepper ceviche, will probably order Lemon Hot every time.</p><p>What’s the best flavor of Wingstop wings? Answering that question takes not only an<strong> iron stomach,</strong> but a substantial love of chicken, as between its dry rubs and signature sauces Wingstop offers 14 different flavors to choose from. They must be doing something right, though, as according to Nation’s Restaurant News the Texas-based chain saw a 20% growth in sales between 2019 and 2020. And QSR Magazine named it one of the fastest growing restaurants, chicken or otherwise, in America.</p><p>Much like Hawaiian Punch and Hawaiian pizza, really the only thing Hawaiian about this Wingstop sauce is its name.<strong> It’s much more of a sweet and sour, where the sugary, syrupy notes hit your tongue before succumbing to a soft, sour aftertaste.</strong></p><p>And part of the reason Wingstop has gotten so popular is that<strong> it really does offer something for everyone.</strong> Whether you’re into Asian flavors, buttery stuff, citrus, garlic, or knock-your-face-off heat, you’ll find something on this menu that fits.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For children, the heat-sensitive, and those just dipping their toes into the wonderful world of wings,<strong> no sauce works better than the Hickory Barbecue </strong>. The sweet, smoky flavor is palatable for just about anyone, and even those who expect some kick with their wings won’t be mad as it still has a peppery finish at the end.</p><p>Now, if you don’t like spice, mild is the move, a classic buttery wing sauce with hints of red pepper. It’s a little richer and smoother than some of the spicier sauces, thanks to the abundance of butter. That flavor is fairly inoffensive, but can leave you feeling a little weighed down if you’re not into dairy.</p><p>That said, Wingstop absolutely nails the cayenne flavor here, as the wings have a distinct pepper taste that emulates the base in a lot of cajun food. The problem is, Wingstop … stopped. And didn’t add much else to round out the full Louisiana flavor. If you love cayenne pepper, though, these are the wings for you.</p><h2>What is a wingstop?</h2><p>Wingstop is<strong> one of Americas’ most popular fast-food chain restaurants.</strong> They specialize in chicken wings and call themselves the “Wing Experts” and rightly so.
