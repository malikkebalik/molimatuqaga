That's the same as around $35 million in today's dollars. His enduring legacy includes innovations like scat singing and an emphasis on solo performance in jazz. Some of his major accomplishments include iconic performances such as 'What a Wonderful World' and 'Hello, Dolly!', which remain timeless classics.</p><p>Louis Armstrong was born in New Orleans, Louisiana to a very poor family. The grandson of slaves, Armstrong spent his childhood and youth in extreme poverty, especially after his dad took off with another woman. Louis was eleven when he quit school to earn money for his family by singing in a quartet of boys who were performing on the street. This was the year when Armstrong was first introduced with the cornet by cornet player Bunk Johnson. After spending some time in a home for troubled kids, he went on to work at day and develop his music skills at night. He even performed with local jazz bands when he got the chance.</p><p>It was Joe "King" Oliver who first recognized Louis' talent. Mentored by the famous cornet player, Louis did various small jobs for Oliver in return. After his tutor left for Chicago, the world´s center of jazz at the time, Louis started performing on steam boats that were touring down and up the Mississippi River. This helped him hone his skills and even learn how to read music.</p><p>In 1922, Louis went to Chicago to join Oliver's band. In 1924, Louis moved to New York at the request of acclaimed bandleader Fetcher Henderson. In New&nbsp; York he switched to playing the trumpet and developed energetic and creative style that caught the ear of the New York jazz scene. He soon moved back to Chicago to play with his Hot Five and Hot Seven groups, creating such hits as "Potato Head Blues," "Muggles" and "West End Blues." The rhythms that he created in the process became the standard and the agenda for jazz musicians for many years to come. As for his trademark music genres, they are dixieland, jazz, swing, traditional pop. Even though he was living in a severely racially divided America, Louis Armstrong managed to cross racial boundaries and became one of the most famous jazz musicians of the 20th century. The world lost a great man and rarely talented musician when Armstrong died in his sleep from a heart attack on July 6, 1971.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-249751 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GettyImages-652335363.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-249751 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Armstrong was born in a neighborhood known as "The Battlefield" in New Orleans, Louisiana.
