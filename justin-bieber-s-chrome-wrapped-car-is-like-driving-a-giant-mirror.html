It’s part of the reason for his blockbuster success as a singer and songwriter. But his drive for differentiating himself transcends far beyond his music. His style and&nbsp;<a href=#>even the expensive cars</a>&nbsp;he drives all have unique customization.</p><p id=par-2_38>One of his&nbsp;rarest gems in the garage, <a href=#>Bieber had wrapped</a> entirely in chrome. Driving this exotic ride around the city, as you can imagine, can be blinding to oncoming traffic as it resembles a giant mirror on wheels.</p><h2>Justin Bieber’s fame started early</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_37>What began as a young boy on a YouTube video quickly transitioned to incredible fame and stardom for Justin Bieber. He almost immediately landed a record deal with Usher and began cranking out Top 40 hits.</p><p id=par-4_34>In fact, he was&nbsp;the first solo artist&nbsp;to land four singles on the charts before even launching a debut album, according to<a href=#> Biography.com</a>. His 2009 effort, My World, went platinum on a global scale.</p><p id=par-5_49>He’s&nbsp;<a href=#>had some unsavory headlines</a>, as he matured through the tough teenage years. But he made enough comebacks to keep his fan base engaged and his revenue streams flowing. As of this year, reports say he’s worth $265 million, due to his album sales, endorsements, tours, and his YouTube series.</p><h2>A few of the exotic cars in his celebrity collection</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_50>On par with being different, Justin Bieber charts his own path in terms of expensive cars in his collection. He bought his <a href=#>first Lamborghini Aventador</a> when he turned 18. But soon he recognized exotic cars are a dime a dozen in his social circles, so customizing became a necessity.</p><p id=par-7_53>He has an Audi R8 with a bizarre leopard print wrap job. He even has a Cadillac CTS V coupe that is tricked out to <a href=#>resemble a Batmobile</a>. And if blacked-out body kits and tints on a Batman-style Cadillac weren’t enough, Bieber had to be sure to also own the matching motorbike, too.</p><h2>The rare car Justin Bieber had wrapped in chrome</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Justin-Bieber-Chrome-Car.jpg><p id=par-8_36>One of the unique high-end vehicles in Justin Bieber’s garage of multi-million dollar cars is the Fisker Karma. This small automaker brand specializes in electric vehicle technology, matched with a completely unprecedented luxury car design.</p><p id=par-9_28>Not entirely in production for the masses yet, Fisker Karma did produce a few vehicles whose owners include the <a href=#>environmentally-conscious Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, and you guessed it, Justin Bieber.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_30>He got his&nbsp;$100,000 Fisker Karma&nbsp;as a birthday gift on the Ellen DeGeneres Show when he turned 18, according to <a href=#>Jalopnik</a>. But having an uncommon luxury car isn’t good enough.</p><p id=par-11_35>Bieber spent an estimated extra $10,000 and had his Fisker Karma wrapped entirely in chrome. It looks&nbsp;like a giant mirror, and one can only imagine what kind of glare other drivers might experience around it.</p><h2>Celebrities are all about differentiating with customization</h2><p id=par-12_50>From Paris Hilton’s blush pink Bentley Continental GT to Chris Brown’s color-changing Lamborghini, it’s clear, celebs want their sweet rides to stand out from the others. Many of&nbsp;<a href=#>these cars are rare</a>&nbsp;to the rest of us, and a chance to own or even afford a stock model would be life-changing.</p><p id=par-13_36>But in Hollywood and within the social circles of the wealthy elite, having stock anything is just a waste of money. Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Kim Kardashian West all have custom extras on their favorite rides.</p><p id=par-14_45>No one has confirmed why Justin Bieber opted for a complete chrome wrap on his Fisker Karma. But it certainly looks like a sleek and sporty mirror on wheels. And maybe that’s just it. Bieber has a way to check his hair everywhere he goes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3tr%2FToqVmmpmar6a%2B0maaoaqforJuw9Gap6mdlGKwor6MoqpmpJmgsm6w0aKtoqaXYq5us8iapa1lnZ6%2Fs7vRZ5%2BtpZxk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
