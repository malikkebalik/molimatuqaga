And honestly, <a href=#>working on deck</a> is a very masculine energy job.”</p><h2>Brittini shares why she had ‘yacht goggles’ for Culver on ‘Below Deck Down Under’</h2><p id=par-6_65>Burton connected the most with Bradbury in terms of a fun boatmance. “So, to tap into that flirty, feminine essence was really fun,” she explained. “And the person I felt I could do that the most with was Culver. So that’s where this whole thing came from. And at the time I was like, why not? Culver you wanna make out, like let’s go.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_53>The Below Deck Down Under crew also cosigned the boatmance. “That’s really where it was, the yacht goggles are on so much,” she said. “Then also the crew as a whole, multiple times were like, ‘Yes, you guys are so cute.’ It wasn’t just me, it was my environment and my personality.”</p><p id=par-8_44>“Just like I’m down to make out,” she added, just wanting to have fun. “That’s really where it was going. And so yeah, at the end of the day, like, we do have compatibility, but it’s not a romantic compatibility, it’s friendship compatibility.”</p><h2 id=h-culver-s-many-breaks-in-the-end-were-annoying-the-below-deck-down-under-crew>Culver’s many breaks, in the end, were annoying the ‘Below Deck Down Under’ crew</h2><p id=par-9_52>Wondering if Burton and Crawley noticed that Bradbury was doing more napping than working during that final charter? Not only did they notice, but they were also a little annoyed, especially when <a href=#>bosun Jamie Sayed</a> elevated Bradbury as the unofficial lead deckhand and he was literally laying down on the job.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_46>“It was something that really was bothering me too near the end, because, man, it is hard work,” she said. “I get it. Take as many naps as you can. But, even Benny pointed out that he was taking more breaks than any of us.”</p><p id=par-11_92>“And so it kind of loses morale when one of the team members isn’t pulling their weight up, when in the beginning, he was the lead deckhand. Not labeled [lead deckhand] but there’s Jamie and then there’s Culver,” she shared. “So, yeah, it was frustrating. I don’t know [why]. I just think it’s a long season, so he was just kind of like knowing that it was almost the end because really there’s the last week. So knowing that it was almost done, it probably just got into his head too much.”</p><p id=par-12_15>The&nbsp;Below Deck Down Under&nbsp;Season 1 finale will air Tuesday at 9 pm ET on Bravo.</p><p id=par-13_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvs7XTraCnoV2axbG4wKKlrGWplrCpwIygpqCfnJrAbq%2FUpa2eql2Xsq271mabnpubYrGww81mrKeclad6pLTAq6ueql2irqV5wqGcnKOVmXqmusNnn62lnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
