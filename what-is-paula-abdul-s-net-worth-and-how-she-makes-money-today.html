Following her stint as a Laker Girl, she became a&nbsp;choreographer. Her first major gig was when she was hired by The Jacksons to&nbsp;choreograph the group’s dance number for the video “Torture.” Abdul ended up choreographing their Victory Tour and later worked with their sister, Janet Jackson, to choreograph the moves done in her “Nasty” and “Control” videos.</p><p id=par-4_37>Abdul’s success coordinating dance routines extended beyond working just with musicians as she was pegged to arrange dance sequences for a number of films including&nbsp;<i>Can’t Buy Me Love</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Running Man</i>,&nbsp;<i>Big</i>,&nbsp;<i>Coming to America</i>,&nbsp;<i>Action Jackson</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Doors</i>,&nbsp;<i>Jerry Maguire</i>, and&nbsp;<i>American Beauty.&nbsp;</i></p><p id=par-5_67>For her singing career that was very successful as well. Abdul recorded three albums&nbsp;<span id=1987–1999:_Forever_Your_Girl,_Spellbound_and_Head_over_Heels class=mw-headline><i>Forever Your Girl</i>,&nbsp;<i>Spellbound</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Head over Heels&nbsp;</i>between 1988 and 1995. The albums had commercial&nbsp;success and produced six No. 1 tracks. Abdul then took some time away from music and in&nbsp;</span>2002, she was tapped to serve as one of judges on the reality competition that launched&nbsp;Ryan Secreast’s career and made Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson household names.</p><p id=par-6_61>The “ForeverYour Girl” singer left the series in 2009 but later served as a judge on&nbsp;<span id=2010–present:_Live_to_Dance,_The_X_Factor_and_So_You_Think_You_Can_Dance class=mw-headline><i>Live to Dance</i>,&nbsp;<i>The X Factor,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>So You Think You Can Dance.&nbsp;</i>She’s also had a few other business&nbsp;ventures with endorsement deals as well as a jewelry line on QVC. Abdul’s <a href=#>net worth is an estimated $30 million</a> and she still raking in plenty of cash today by touring.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Paula-Abdul-performing-1-e1540221143597.jpg><p id=par-7_61>In 2017, the songstress toured with New Kids on the Block and Boyz II Men. She said that tour reminded her of how much she enjoyed being on the road and performing for her fans so she decided to embark on her own tour the following year. The Straight Up Paula! 2018 tour marks her first solo tour in 25 years.</p><p id=par-8_95>In October, Abdul made headlines when <a href=#>video circulated online</a> of her falling off the stage during one of her shows. While singing&nbsp;her hit “The Promise of a New Day” at Hard Rock Live in Biloxi, Mississippi, Abdul walked to the edge of the stage and leaned forward as if to greet her fans when she suddenly fell into the audience and out of view. Shrieks could be heard from the crowd but <a href=#>a concertgoer told Entertainment Tonight</a> that Abdul was a total pro and just dusted herself off, got right back up, and continued her&nbsp;performance.</p><p id=par-9_53>“After the fall, she got back up, never skipped a beat! [Abdul] stated, she has been a dancer for years so falls and drops she has gotten used to over the years,” the fan said. “Other than the fall her show was absolutely amazing and she went on and finished like a champ!”</p><p id=par-10_11>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=#>Betty White’s Net Worth and How She Made Her Fortune</a></p><p id=par-11_5><i>Check out&nbsp;</i><a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s1><i>The Cheat Sheet</i></span></a><i>&nbsp;on Facebook!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZaCWwq2tjJqZna2cqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ16orrDZp%2Bor12otaZ5zJqinqtdoryvsdhmq6icka57qcDMpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
