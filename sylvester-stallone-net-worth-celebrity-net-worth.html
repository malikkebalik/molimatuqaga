He left school before completing his degree and moved to New York City to pursue acting as a career.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Sylvester-Stallone-1.jpg alt="Sylvester Stallone Net Worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294427 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><b>Career</b></h2><p>Stallone's first starring role was in "The Party at Kitty and Stud's", a softcore adult film. Stallone would later explain that he did the movie out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment. He was paid $200 for two days of work.</p><p>His first few early film roles were minor, including an uncredited role in <a href=# title="Woody Allen Net Worth">Woody Allen</a>'s 1971 film "Bananas." In 1973 he had a role in a movie called "Rebel" and in 1974 he earned some early critical praise for his work in "The Lords of Flatbush."</p><p>In the mid-1970s Stallone made the decision to move to Los Angeles. During his free time he wrote screenplays. Inspired by a <a href=# title="Muhammad Ali Net Worth">Muhammad Ali</a> versus <a href=# title="Chuck Wepner Net Worth">Chuck Wepner</a> flight he'd seen, he wrote a screenplay about a struggling underdog thug with ambitions to become a professional boxer. Stallone reportedly refused to sell the script unless he was the star of the film. He held out until he found Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, two producers who were willing to let him play the lead role of Rocky Balboa. The name "Balboa" came to him because his LA apartment was two blocks away from Balboa Avenue.</p><p>In 1976, "Rocky" was released. Despite some luke-warm test screenings, the movie would go on to become a Global phenomenon, catapulting Stallone to instant A-list status and world fame. The film was a critical and box office hit, and went on to earn $117 million at the box office, off a budget of $1 million, It earned ten Academy Award nominations. It was up for Best Picture against other now-classic films such as "All the President's Men," "Network," and "Taxi Driver," but incredibly Rocky clinched the win.

He attempted to make movies in the comedy genre, but was met with critical and commercial disasters in the form of early-nineties movies "Oscar" and "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot." Stallone enjoyed a brief career warm up with "Cliffhanger" in 1993, which grossed U.S. $170 million, as well as 1996's "Daylight", but by the early 2000s he was acting in a string of box office disappointments and critical letdowns.</p><p>Stallone took a three-year hiatus, and in 2006 had a comeback with the sixth "Rocky" film. He wrote, directed, and starred in critically-acclaimed "Rocky Balboa", which had a budget of $24 million and made $155.7 million worldwide. He also reprised his role of Rambo in the fourth installment of that series, "Rambo." In 2010, he wrote, directed, and starred in the successful "The Expendables", which went straight to No. 1 at the box office upon opening weekend. A sequel was released in 2012 to similarly positive reviews and a No. 1 slot in the box office.</p><p>In 2015, Stallone added another chapter of the Rocky series with a spin-off film, Creed.

The two ultimately reconciled.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1999 Sylvester sold a home in Coconut Grove, Florida, for $16 million.</p><p>For the last few decades, Sylvester's primary residence has been an opulent mansion in the tony gated community at the top of Beverly Hills called Beverly Park. His property spans 3.5 acres and features a 20,000 square-foot home. Nearby neighbors include <a href=# title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth">Eddie Murphy</a>, <a href=# title="Mark Wahlberg Net Worth">Mark Wahlberg</a> and <a href=# title="Denzel Washington Net Worth">Denzel Washington</a>. Similar homes have sold recently for $40 â€“ $70 million. In January 2021 it was reported that Sylvester was listing this home for a staggering $130 million. In August 2021 he lowered the price to $85 million.</p><p>In December 2021 Sylvester accepted a $58 million offer.

The sellers of the property cleared nearly $10 million in profits from the sale, having acquired the property in 2018 for $26 million.</p><p>In February 2022 Sylvester paid $18.2 million for a 2.26 acre estate in Hidden Hills, California. Unfortunately this home earned Sly some negative headlines in August 2022 when it was revealed that <a href=#>the property was using an ungodly amount of water</a>. In May 2022 and June 2022 the property exceeded its monthly water allocation by 195,000 gallons and 230,000 gallons, respectively. In their defense, the Stallones claimed the property featured more than 500 mature trees that needed constant watering or they would die and become an extreme fire hazard. If the Stallones exceeded their allocation by 150% in four total months, the local water department reserved the right to place a restrictor on the water before it entered the property.</p><p>Here's a video tour from when it was listed in early 2022:</p><p></p><p>In December 2022, less than year after purchasing the property for $18.2 million, Sylvester listed it for sale for $22.5 million.
