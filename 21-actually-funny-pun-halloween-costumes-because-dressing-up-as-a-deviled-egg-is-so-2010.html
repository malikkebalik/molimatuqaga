Should you push ahead into new, uncharted pun waters this year? Explore new, exciting idiom-based outfits? Or should you just whip out the old "deviled egg" costume and call it a day?

Do you love carbs so much that you MUST KILL THEM? Then go to town.</p><h3>NUTTY PROFESSOR</h3><p>Finally, enough time has passed that you can bust this one out and not remind everyone of those crappy Eddie Murphy movies where he played like 39 different characters.</p><h3>POT HEAD</h3><p>Topical! And also possibly a good way to get people to offer you pot (not that I would know).</p><h3>SPELLING BEE</h3><p>No, Drunk Guy Outside the 7-11, I am not <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the bee girl from the Blind Melon video</a>.</p><h3>SIGN LANGUAGE</h3><p>Yes, you'll take this poster board off after ten minutes and lose it in a corner somewhere — but what a thrilling ten minutes those ten minutes will be!</p><h3>BASEBALL BAT</h3><p>Exercise caution around anyone who invites you to check out their "base balls," though.</p><h3>GINGER BREAD PERSON</h3><p>He's a ginger bread man, you could be a ginger bread woman ... we're all just ginger bread PEOPLE, man.</p><h3>HAWAIIAN PUNCH</h3><p>An easy and stylish tribute to America's most violent soft drink.</p><h3>SOMEONE YOU CAN COUNT ON</h3><p>The only Halloween costume that also qualifies as light workplace brown-nosing.</p><h3>FORK IN THE ROAD</h3><p>No matter what you do, you're going to accidentally stab someone with that fork before the night's over, so best to start preparing mentally now.</p><h3>LIFE, GIVING YOU LEMONS</h3><p>Well, for God's sake, don't take them! It's a trick!</p><h3>DUNKIN' DONUTS</h3><p>Will they give you free donuts if you show up at a Dunkin' Donuts dressed like this? You try and then tell me what happens.</p><h3>BIG BABY</h3><p>Sometimes making a Halloween costume out of the insults your ex called you during your last break-up is actually really cathartic.</p><h3>BRUSH WITH DEATH</h3><p>And then floss with a nagging sense that your best years are behind you.</p><h3>BREADWINNER</h3><p>And if the party you're at isn't everything you'd hoped for, well, at least you have some snacks.</p><h3>WILSON PHILLIPS</h3><p>Yes, that's Captain Phillips from <i>Captain Phillips</i> and Wilson the volleyball from <i>Castaway</i>. Of course, the real question is: is there a secret thread relating early '90s lite rock girl groups running through all of Tom Hanks' movies? Has anyone checked <i>Larry Crowne</i>?</p><h3>TIE FIGHTER</h3><p>It's a pun and it's related to <i>Star Wars</i>, so you're testing high in two demographics (two demographics with a fairly strong overlap, perhaps, but still)!</p><h3>JACKIE O-LANTERN</h3><p>Yeah, we're getting a little more conceptual here right now. Can you take it? CAN YOU TAKE IT OR DO YOU NEED TO RUN CRYING BACK TO YOUR "DEVILED EGG" COSTUME, HUH?</p><h3>JURASSIC PARKS AND REC</h3><p>I die.</p><p><i>Images: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Giphy</i></a></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx1gZZpaWZqYWKupMDUmqOlsV2bwq%2B62GanrqZdna6tuM6wnJ6mXZi8tMDUppysZZKasKLB0p5knaqVqMCqusZmrKllkah6onnDnq2ipJWZeqazxmagrGWjpHpzfJBp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
