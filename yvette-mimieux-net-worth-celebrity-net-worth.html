She was the daughter of a Mexican mother, Maria Montemayor, and a French father, RenÃ© Mimieux, and she grew up with brother Edouardo and sister Gloria. Yvette launched her career after meeting talent manager Jim Byron. According to Mimieux's obituary in "The Guardian," "She was only 15 when the talent agent Jim Byron supposedly spotted her from his helicopter while she walked a horse in the Hollywood Hills; he landed and gave her his card. The other version of the story was more mundane: he spotted her auditioning for a bit part in <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a> Presley's 'Jailhouse Rock.' He generated publicity for her through beauty contests and modelling." When Yvette was 17 years old, she made her television debut with a guest-starring role on "Yancy Derringer" in 1959.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247076 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/GettyImages-3291624.jpg alt width=464 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-247076 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After making her TV debut, Mimieux guest-starred on "Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond" (1960), "Mr. Lucky" (1960), and "Dr. Kildare" (1964) and appeared in the MGM films "Platinum High School" (1960), "The Time Machine" (1960), "Where the Boys Are" (1960), "Light in the Piazza" (1962), and "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" (1962).

Yvette produced and starred in the 1984 TV movie "Obsessive Love," which she co-wrote with Iris Friedman and Petru Popescu. She said of "Obsessive Love," "There are few enough films going these days, and there are three or four women who are offered all the good parts. Of course I could play a lot of awful parts that are too depressing to contemplateâ€¦. [Television is] not the love affair I have with film, but television can be a playground for interesting ideas. I love wild, baroque, slightly excessive theatrical ideas, and because television needs so much material, there's a chance to get some of those odd ideas done." In 1990, Mimieux appeared in the TV movie "Perry Mason: The Case of the Desperate Deception," and her final acting role was Deena Swanson in the 1992 miniseries "Lady Boss," which was based on the 1990 <a href=# title="Jackie Collins Net Worth">Jackie Collins</a> novel of the same name.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>On December 19, 1959, Yvette married Evan Harland Engber at the age of 17.
