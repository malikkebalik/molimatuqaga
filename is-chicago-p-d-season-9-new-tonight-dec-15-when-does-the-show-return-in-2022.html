Season 9 Episode 9, <a href=#>Jay Halstead teamed up with Hank Voight</a> despite FBI Agent North’s threats. The agent told Halstead he could either turn Voight in for Roy Walton’s death or Halstead and Hailey Upton would take the fall. Halstead and Voight then came up with a plan to use against North — and it worked. Halstead, Upton, and Voight walked away from the investigation with their livelihoods still intact.</p><p id=par-4_33>As for <a href=#>Upton and Halstead, they decided to elope</a> at the end of the episode. They rushed to City Hall to tie the knot without telling anyone on the Intelligence Unit, including Voight.</p><p id=par-5_69>Fans hoped for Chicago P.D. Season 9 to be new tonight, Dec. 15, 2021. Unfortunately, NBC’s One Chicago fans will have to wait for more content. NBC isn’t airing new episodes of the show, and reruns also won’t air during the typical Chicago P.D. timeslot at 10 p.m. EST. Instead, NBC’s holiday scheduling begins. Kelly Clarkson Presents: When Christmas Comes Around airs at 10 p.m. EST on Dec. 15.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When does ‘Chicago P.D.’ return in 2022?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hank-Voight-1.jpg><p id=par-6_26>When does Chicago P.D.
