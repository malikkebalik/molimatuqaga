In 2005, they spent $9 million on a 6,700 square foot home in New York City and later sold it for a $3 million profit. In May 2014, Consuelos and Ripa sold a different NYC home for $24.5 million. Today their primary residence is a 5-bedroom NYC townhouse that's worth at least $30 million. The five-story home has an elevator that takes people up to a private rooftop patio and garden. For vacations, they have a ski home in Telluride, Colorado and a beach home in the Hamptons. The couple bought their Hamptons home for $2.35 million in 2004. It's likely that this home is worth $10-15 million today. Their combined real estate portfolio is worth at least $45 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLqivspmmqimo6qyrbvSZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
