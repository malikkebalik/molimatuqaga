The actors spent nearly four years together making the four films in the series:<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> The Hunger Games</a>, Catching Fire, Mockingjay – Part 1, and Mockingjay – Part 2. As the films achieved immense popularity, many of the cast members developed a strong bond, which still persists today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Liam-Hemsworth-Jennifer-Lawrence-Josh-Hutcherson-Woody-Harrelson-and-Francis-Lawrence.jpg><p id=par-2_65>The bond between the three main cast members, Jennifer Lawrence, <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a>, and Liam Hemsworth was exceptionally strong because they were all around similar ages. All three leads have expressed how much they enjoyed filming The Hunger Games movies. The set was often filled with laughter and endless pranking. Lawrence even carried pranking over into scenes, often <a href=#>eating disgusting foods before kissing scenes with Hemsworth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘The Hunger Games’ cast had a lot of fun together while filming the movies</h2><p id=par-3_88>In fact, The Hunger Games set was so playful, that Hutcherson likened it to a college experience. He shared that they goofed off so much that <a href=#>he’s surprised that anything ever got done</a>. And the fooling around wasn’t limited to the set of the movies either. The cast often kept the same energy when they got together outside of filming. In an interview with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>BBC Radio 1</a>, Lawrence recalled a particularly over-the-top interaction that she had with Woody Harrelson, who played Haymitch Abernathy in the films.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_66>“Francis [Lawrence, who directed the last three films in The Hunger Games series] and I were talking about this party last night that I had on like the first week, I think, of filming in my apartment,” the Red Sparrow star shared. “And it was just like ‘I’m having a little get together in my apartment’ and then he came in and there were two weapons.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jennifer Lawrence revealed her castmate gagged her with socks</h2><p id=par-5_73>Lawrence continued on to share that her fellow Hunger Games co-star proceeded to attack her with one of the “weapons.” “There was a nerf disc and Woody’s gross vegan socks. He chased me around my apartment. I flipped over the couch trying to get away from him. He pinned me down and forced the socks so far down my throat that when he ripped it out I like almost threw up. I gagged.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_58>Naturally, being gagged with socks isn’t one of Lawrence’s fondest memories from filming The Hunger Games movies. But, it certainly is one of the most salient. However, when the actor was asked about her favorite part of being in the franchise, she cited her fellow castmates as what truly made the experience special and memorable for her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lawrence reflects on her favorite part of shooting ‘The Hunger Games’ series</h2><p id=par-7_82>“The relationships that I made,” Lawrence stated about the best part of shooting the popular movies. “You know Josh, Liam, Woody, and Francis and I, we were like family. Woody used to always call me mama duck ’cause Josh and Liam would always follow me,” she confessed. It’s clear that the cast of The Hunger Games was truly tight-knit. While the tone of the films is dark, it’s obvious that the darkness didn’t stop them from experiencing plenty of lighthearted fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMoaynn5WneqitzJ6qZqKVo7uqssSrZKWZp6eyr6%2FEZqmem5GhubR5wGaamqukoq61sYysn6iumaO0br%2FOnKKsZZSkxK95x56pZqyYp7yiwI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
