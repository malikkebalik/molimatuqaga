The Washington Nationals are still enjoying their first-ever title, while the Houston Astros are wondering what could have been.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With the league's Winter Meetings right around the corner, we thought it'd be a good time to look at the most valuable franchises in Major League Baseball. The values are courtesy of Forbes' annual franchise value list. Holding the number one spot? Why, it's the team with more championships than any other.</span></p><p><b>New York Yankees – $4.6 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Perhaps it's no surprise that the Yankees are at the top of this list. The franchise has a storied history, winning an MLB-high 27 titles over the years. Of course, all that success (and deep pockets) have helped bring major stars to the Bronx. While guys like <a href=# title="Derek Jeter Net Worth">Derek Jeter</a> and <a href=# title="Aaron Judge Net Worth">Aaron Judge</a> came up through the Yankees' system, they've been able to score big-name free agents like <a href=# title="Alex Rodriguez Net Worth">Alex Rodriguez</a> and <a href=# title="Giancarlo Stanton Net Worth">Giancarlo Stanton</a>. Despite the franchise's long-term success, the Yankees have now gone a decade since their last championship.</span></p><p><b>Los Angeles Dodgers – $3.3 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, ten years since a championship seems like child's play compared to the Dodgers, who haven't won a World Series since 1988. They've had extended success, though, including winning seven straight NL West titles. Like the Yankees, it helps that the Dodgers play in a huge market. Their value will remain high even if they can't break through and win a championship.</span></p><p><b>Boston Red Sox – $3.2 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, the Red Sox have taken home four titles since 2004, most recently last year. Their rivalry with the Yankees certainly helps, as does having a strong lineup with guys like <a href=# title="Xander Bogaerts Net Worth">Xander Bogaerts</a> and <a href=# title="Mookie Betts Net Worth">Mookie Betts</a>. However, the Red Sox could find themselves in trouble in 2020. After a disappointing season, the payroll remains bloated.</span></p><p><b>Chicago Cubs – $3.1 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# title="Kris Bryant Net Worth">Kris Bryant</a>, <a href=# title="Anthony Rizzo Net Worth">Anthony Rizzo</a>, <a href=# title="Jon Lester Net Worth">Jon Lester</a> and the rest of the Cubs turned from lovable losers into World Series champs in 2016. The title ended a 108-year drought in the Windy City. Even if the Cubs never win another championship, that team will go down as legends. Though the Cubs have had several winning seasons in a row, they're a great example of a team not needing to win a championship to be valuable. Even before 2016, the Cubs routinely sold out, thanks to a historic stadium and prominence in one of the country's largest cities.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-290273 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/GettyImages-861385582.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-290273 class=wp-caption-text>Bob Levey/Getty Images</p><p><b>San Francisco Giants – $3 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The first half of this decade belonged to the San Francisco Giants. The team won the World Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014 behind stars like <a href=# title="Tim Lincecum Net Worth">Tim Lincecum</a> and <a href=# title="Buster Posey Net Worth">Buster Posey</a>. The years since have been less kind, with just one playoff appearance since then. Being in the Bay Area has its perks, though, as does having one of the most loyal fanbases in the major leagues. In fact, from 2010 to 2017, the Giants set a National League record with 530 consecutive sold out games.</span></p><p><b>New York Mets – $2.3 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>After the top five teams, there's a significant dropoff in value to number six. New York's "other" team, the Mets, holds that spot. The Mets were one of baseball's first expansion teams in 1962, replacing the departed Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants. They've had significantly less success than their cross-town rivals, with just two World Series titles (in 1969 and 1986). Still, playing in New York helps boost their value. And the Mets have plenty of famous fans, too, like <a href=# title="Jerry Seinfeld Net Worth">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, <a href=# title="Chris Rock Net Worth">Chris Rock</a>, and <a href=# title="Jimmy Kimmel Net Worth">Jimmy Kimmel</a>.</span></p><p><b>St. Louis Cardinals – $2.1 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Cardinals are in a smaller market than every other team on this list, but they possess one of the most storied histories in the majors. Their 11 World Series titles are second only to the Yankees, and being in existence since 1900 has offered plenty of memorable moments. Their ROI has been impressive for owner William DeWitt, Jr. – his ownership group purchased the team for $147 million in 1995. In a quarter-century, he's seen his franchise's value rise by more than 1300 percent.</span></p><p><b>Los Angeles Angels – $1.9 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Angels have routinely played second fiddle to the Dodgers, though part of that is their location. Anaheim is about an hour south of Los Angeles, and for a while, the team went by the clunky name "The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim." They wisely ditched that moniker and capitalized on their proximity to the country's second-largest city. The team hasn't been competitive for a while, though they've had their fair share of big-name stars come through over the past decade, including <a href=# title="Albert Pujols Net Worth">Albert Pujols</a> and <a href=# title="Josh Hamilton Net Worth">Josh Hamilton</a>.</span></p><p><b>Philadelphia Phillies – $1.85 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sporting perhaps the most famous mascot in MLB, the Phillies (and the Phillie Phanatic) are the oldest continuous one-name, one-city franchise in the majors. They were founded in 1883 as the Philadelphia Quakers, though quickly changed to the Phillies, which is why their record for longevity still stands. The team has won two World Series titles (in 1980 and 2008).</span></p><p><b>Houston Astros – $1.775 Billion</b></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>With two World Series appearances and one title in the past three years, the Astros round out this list of the top ten most valuable franchises. However, the team has recently come under scrutiny amid allegations of stealing signs during their World Series run in 2017. We'll see if that affects their franchise value, but with marketable stars including <a href=# title="Jose Altuve Net Worth">Jose Altuve</a>, <a href=# title="George Springer Net Worth">George Springer</a>, and <a href=# title="Zack Greinke Net Worth">Zack Greinke</a>, we'd bet the Astros will be just fine.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnquVYq6zsYytn55lYWV6rrvSrWSvmZyqrqO4xGakpZpdm7%2BiusKhoKydo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
