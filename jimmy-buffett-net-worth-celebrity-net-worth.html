Unfortunately, Jimmy died on Sept 2, 2023 at the age of 76.</p><p>Jimmy Buffett earned a fortune embodying the "island escapism" lifestyle. He was perhaps best known for the hit songs "Margaritaville,"and "Cheeseburger in Paradise," both of which became anthems for those looking to escape the daily grind. Buffett's musical style is a unique blend of country, rock, folk and pop, infused with coastal and tropical lyrical themes.</p><p>Starting his career in the late 1960s, Buffett initially struggled to make a significant impact in the music industry. However, with the release of albums like "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes" in 1977, which featured "Margaritaville," he cemented his status as a mainstream artist. He would go on to release more than 30 albums, and his concerts were often sold-out events featuring devoted fans, known as "Parrotheads," dressed in tropical attire.</p><p>Beyond music, Buffett built a business empire embodying the very lifestyle he sang about. This empire, <a href=#>which made him a billionaire</a>, included restaurants, hotels, and even a line of merchandise. In typical years Buffett earned $50-100 million from his musical and business ventures. As of this writing there are dozens Margaritaville locations around the world. There are restaurants, casinos, hotels and vacation clubs. There are also dozens of retail outlets. The Margaritaville empire is owned by Margaritaville Holdings LLC, which is itself a subsidiary of Cheesburger Holding Company, LLC.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-154218 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Jimmy-Buffet.jpg alt width=594 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-154218 class=wp-caption-text>Rick Diamond/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>James William Buffett was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on Christmas Day (December 25), 1946. He spent his childhood in the cities of Mobile and Fairhope, Alabama. He attended grade school at St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone. He first enrolled at Auburn University for college, before continuing his education at Pearl River Community College at the University of Southern Mississippi, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1969. Following graduation from college, he worked a Billboard magazine correspondent in Nashville.</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Buffett's musical career began in Nashville, Tennessee, during the 1960s. He recorded his first album in 1970, country-tinged folk-rock number "Down to Earth." Buffett, who had been frequently found busking for tourists in New Orleans at the time, was soon taken by music singer <a href=# title="Jerry Jeff Walker Net Worth">Jerry Jeff Walker</a> on a busking expedition to Key West in November 1971. This prompted Buffett to move to Key West and establish the easy-going beach-bum persona for which he is known. There, Buffett combined both folk and country music with coastal lyrical themes that produced a sound commonly known as the "gulf and western" sound. Thanks to his instant party hits, he gained a loyal following. Before 2003, songs played at every Buffett show were known as the "Big 8," including the song "Margaritaville" that helped him break into the mainstream. Other songs part of the "Big 8" include "Come Monday," "Fins," "Volcano," "A Pirate Looks at Forty," "Cheeseburger in Paradise," "Why Don't We Get Drunk," and "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes." With his 30+ album releases, eight of which are Gold and nine Platinum or Multiplatinum, and around 40 live tours to date, he has remained faithful to his well-established persona known as the easy-going beach-bum guy. He also enjoys a dedicated fan-base, nicknamed "Parrotheads."</p><p>During a performance in Nashville in April 2023, Buffett announced he recorded an album titled "Equal Strain on All Parts" that is yet to be released.</p><p>"<strong>When you wrote that song, did you have any idea what it would become?</strong>"</p><p>Buffett responded:</p><p>"<strong>It's been a pretty good song. No, it was written in five minutes about a hot day in Austin, Texas, with a margarita and a beautiful woman. I finished it in Key West. I had no idea.</strong>"</p><h2 id=writing-career><strong>Writing Career</strong></h2><p>Buffett is a successful writer, having written three number one bestsellers.
