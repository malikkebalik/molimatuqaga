The bastardization of all that’s sacred is complete. Hilary Duff’s latest single is a blatant rip-off of one Depeche Mode’s biggest songs, Personal Jesus, except she changes the loner-and-loser lyrics to bubble-gum sexual innuendo-lite and steals Britney Spears’ vocal machine. For all you youngsters out there, Depeche Mode was the emo of the 80s. I’m obviously showing my age, but People are People instantly transports me back to junior high school dance parties."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hilary Duff’s latest single is a blatant rip-off of one Depeche Mode’s biggest songs, Personal Jesus, except she changes the loner-and-loser lyrics to bubble-gum sexual innuendo-lite and steals Britney Spears’ vocal machine.</p><p>For all you youngsters out there, Depeche Mode was the emo of the 80s. I’m obviously showing my age, but People are People instantly transports me back to junior high school dance parties.</p><p>Personal Jesus was released in 1989. It was actually inspired by Elvis Presley, according to band member Martin Gore.</p><p>It’s a song about being a Jesus for somebody else, someone to give you hope and care. It’s about how Elvis was her man and her mentor and how often that happens in love relationships; how everybody’s heart is like a god in some way, and that’s not a very balanced view of someone, is it?</p><p>[From <a href=#>Wikepedia</a>]</p><p>It’s also about being alone and having someone just as lonely to comfort you in your solitude. When you’re 18 and about to move 1000 miles away for college where you have no friends, it’s bloody brilliant.</p><p>Here are some of the lyrics:</p><p>Your own Personal Jesus<br>Someone to hear your prayers<br>Someone who cares<br>Your own Personal Jesus<br>Someone to hear your prayers<br>Someone who’s there</p><p>Feeling unknown<br>And you’re all alone<br>Flesh and bone<br>By the telephone<br>Lift up the receiver<br>I’ll make you a believer</p><p>Take second best<br>Put me to the test<br>Things on your chest<br>You need to confess<br>I will deliver<br>You know I’m a forgiver</p><p>Reach out and touch faith</p><p>Here are the lyrics to the Hilary Duff version, called Reach Out:</p><p>Tunnel vision had him locked on in my sight<br>On a mission, for position by the end of the night<br>It’s like a prayer, playin’ games with the hunter<br>You better run boy, time to surrender</p><p>And all I need is to feel you<br>All I want is to feel you</p><p>Reach out and touch me<br>Before I go insane<br>Reach out and touch me<br>Boy don’t you make me wait<br>I’m a diamond and you’re so on the money<br>Reach out and touch me<br>And all I need is to feel you<br>Reach out and touch me</p><p>Like a prayer, your touch can take me there<br>Ain’t no mind, you and me in a secret affair<br>Oh boy you’re killing me and you don’t even know it<br>Try to hold back but I can’t control it</p><p>There’s even a rip-off of (or possibly an homage to) Madonna’s Like a Prayer.</p><p>This makes me sad in so many ways. I’m sure Depeche Mode will make a ton of money from it, but music today is so vapid that even Depeche Mode are only in it for the money. Hilary Duff has turned into a poor man’s Britney Spears clone. And I feel old ranting against kids these days and their music.</p><p>I think I’ll go put on The Smiths. That’s sure to cheer me up, at least until Miley Cyrus covers Girlfriend in a Coma.</p><p>For any of you whippersnappers who like the Hilary Duff song, her album Best of Hilary Duff will be released November 11.</p><p>Here’s the original version of Depeche Mode’s “Personal Jesus,” which is much much better.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmanBpan5wtMilmKuxj5nCp7K%2Bm5isrJGnsarGxKyWnZ2gmrCpsb6mpp2dXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
