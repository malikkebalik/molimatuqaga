Its opening weekend numbers edged out the original 2004 movie’s numbers by a couple million dollars (although the OG wins once you adjust it for inflation). I haven’t had a chance to see it yet, but am planning on doing so this weekend. I have been spoiled about Lindsay Lohan’s cameo, though. I couldn’t help it! I had to know and searched to see if any of the original cast members had cameos, and that’s how I found out. It’s a pretty clever role, too. I’m actually pretty excited to see it. Anyway, Lindsay, who lives in Dubai with her husband and son now, did a half-day’s work and reportedly banked a cool $500k for it.</p><p>Sources say Lohan, who became one of young Hollywood’s biggest stars after starring in the 2004 film of the same name, pulled down about $500,000 for a half a day of work in the latest incarnation, a musical that stars a new clique of Plastics led by Angourie Rice and Reneé Rapp. Paramount declined comment. A rep for Lohan declined a request for comment.</p><p>Lohan’s surprise entrance in the new film, written by Tina Fey, drew thunderous applause at the New York premiere on Jan. 8. In her scene, Lohan returns to the math competition that served as the denouement of the original, and offers a full-circle moment for the “Mean Girls” franchise, which also spawned a Broadway musical. The actor also flew in from Dubai to walk the red carpet.</p><p>While Lohan plays neither a flashback version nor an older relative of her “Mean Girls” teen alter ego Cady Heron, her scene offers a clever bridge between the past and the present.</p><p>The musical film, directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr., has already found its groove at the box office, landing the No. 1 spot over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend with a $33.2 million haul domestically. Paramount originally planned to release the $36 million film for streaming only on Paramount+, but reversed course after test screenings indicated there was still a big-screen appetite. Exit polls show the film is appealing to both a Gen Z crowd as well as the over-35 demographic, the latter buoyed by Lohan’s presence, which Paramount managed to keep under wraps until the film’s debut.</p><p><a href=#>[From Yahoo]</a></p><p>I’m actually pretty surprised that they managed to keep Lindsay’s cameo a secret until the premiere, but I love that they were able to. I wish they could have gotten all four original Plastics back in various capacities, like Amanda Seyfried’s Karen playing the town’s actual weatherwoman beyond just that <a href=#>Black Friday commercial</a>. But I get it, all four women have really busy schedules. Still, an Elder Millennial can dream. As for Lindsay’s payday, good for her. Get that money, girl. Is it crazy to make that much money over the course of a few hours? Hell yeah it is. But, if they’re willing to pay, then go collect.</p><p>Unfortunately, LiLo’s 2024 Mean Girls experience wasn’t as great as making a half-mil for one scene and a <a href=#>successful appearance</a> at the premiere. Her rep said she was <a href=#>“very hurt and disappointed”</a> by a scene in the movie in which Megan Thee Stallion makes a comment that references Brandon Davis’ infamous “firecrotch” rant back in 2006.</p><p>“Lindsay was very hurt and disappointed by the reference in the film,” Lohan’s rep says via email, when asked about a line in the new movie that sees rapper Megan Thee Stallion describe the Christmas-inspired outfit worn by Cady Heron (Lohan in the 2004 version, Angourie Rice in the 2024 film) as having “Y2K fire crotch” vibes.</p><p>Gosh, I had forgotten about Greasy Bear Davis and his gross diatribe. It took up so much space in the mid-aughts gossip lexicon, too. I’m sorry LiLo feels hurt by that. On one hand, I think it’s healthy to laugh at yourself to take the power away from bullies, but on the other hand, that was such a tumultuous period in her life that I can also completely understand wanting to leave it in the past. I hope Tina apologized to Lindsay behind the scenes and that all is good between them. At the very least, there’s a $500,000 consolation prize.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coverimages53346571-2.jpg alt width=1100 height=1552 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/avalon-0835419391-1.jpg alt width=1000 height=1300 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><a href=#><img width=150 height=100 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/avalon-0835419386-1-150x100.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img width=115 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/avalon-0835419391-1-115x150.jpg alt aria-describedby=gallery-1-853778 sizes="(max-width: 115px) 100vw, 115px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Lindsay Lohan bei der Premiere des Konifilms Mean Girls: Der Girls Club im AMC Lincoln Square Theater.
