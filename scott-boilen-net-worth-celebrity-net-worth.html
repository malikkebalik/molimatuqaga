Scott Boilen has made his way to riches as the President of Allstar Products, a leading consumer products company that is best known for its Snuggie blanket. Invented in 2008, it is a sleeved and body-length blanket which is similar to a bathrobe that is supposed to be worn backwards. Even though it was deemed by some as a ridiculous idea the Snuggie brought millions to Boilen. Maybe it owes its success to the gentle fleece or Vellux material, either way, the Snuggie managed to sell 20 million items in its first year.</p><p>Thanks to the strong marketing campaign, the unusual blanket accumulated close to $40 million in its first three months. Actually, it became so popular that it has been promoted in various brands like the Snuggler, Doojo, Toastly Wrap, and Slanket. Among the celebrities who gave their nods to the product are <a href=# title="Jay Leno Net Worth">Jay Leno</a>, Whoopie Goldberg and <a href=# title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth">Ellen DeGeneres</a>.
