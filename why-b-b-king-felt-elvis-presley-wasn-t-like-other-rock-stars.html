King was one of many <a href=#>classic rock</a> stars who <a href=#>paved the way for Elvis Presley</a>. King thought Elvis was different from several of his contemporaries. Despite this, King did not fully buy into the mythology surrounding the “Heartbreak Hotel” singer.</p><h2>B.B. King said Elvis Presley didn’t give him the chill that Johnny Cash did</h2><p id=par-2_51>According to the 2021 book <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King of Blues: The Rise and Reign of B.B. King</a>, King met Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash. Each artist was a member of The Million Dollar Quartet, a group of famous musicians who were each signed to Sun Records at one point.</p><p id=par-3_52>King discussed the performers. “I saw all of them, but they didn’t have much to say,” he said. “It wasn’t anything personal, but I might feel a little chill between them and me.” He didn’t reveal why he felt this “chill,” but he didn’t feel it with <a href=#>the “All Shook Up” singer</a>.</p><p id=par-4_66>“Elvis was different,” King recalled. “He was friendly. I remember Elvis distinctly.” King called him “handsome and quiet and polite to a fault.” Elvis credited King with inspiring his career, and treated him like royalty. In King’s recollection, Elvis “spoke with this thick molasses Southern accent and always called me ‘sir.’ I liked that. In the early days, I heard him strictly as a country singer.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>B.B. King resented that Black audiences preferred Elvis Presley to him</h2><p id=par-5_54>King felt Elvis had vocal talent. “I liked his voice, though I had no idea he was getting ready to conquer the world,” he said. Despite this, he rolled his eyes at the <a href=#>so-called King of Rock ‘n’ Roll</a>‘s signature genre, dismissing it as “just more white people doing blues that used different progressions.”</p><p id=par-6_44>King compared Elvis to Arthur Crudup, the artist who wrote and originally performed “That’s All Right.” “[He]was doing Big Boy Crudup’s tunes, and they were calling that ‘rock ‘n’ roll,'” he said. “And I thought it was a way of saying, ‘He’s not Black.'”</p><p id=par-7_45>King didn’t garner as much attention from Black audiences as Elvis did at that time. In the 1950s, Elvis had huge hits on the R&B charts such as “All Shook Up,” “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear,” and “Jailhouse Rock.” Meanwhile, King barely had hits.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-a-recent-film-about-the-love-me-tender-singer-had-the-blues-icon-as-a-minor-character>A recent film about the ‘Love Me Tender’ singer had the blues icon as a minor character</h2><p id=par-8_36>King’s relationship with Elvis was a minor part of Baz Luhrmann’s film Elvis. The film portrays their friendship as warm, although King notes how Elvis is treated far better than him on account of his race.</p><p id=par-9_62>The film introduced many young fans to the <a href=#>“Can’t Help Falling in Love” singer</a>. In addition, the movie produced a soundtrack album, Elvis, which became a modest hit. It reached No. 26 on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard 200</a> and stayed on the chart for 26 weeks in total. Perhaps the movie will also get moviegoers interested in King, his music, and his life story.</p><p id=par-10_18>King didn’t receive as much recognition as the “Jailhouse Rock” singer but hopefully that will change with time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvbq6MpKCnn12bsq3AjJ6jr6GjYr2zsdKlnLJlp5bAr8CMpaCknV2nvKS3jKyrmqqjY7W1ucto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
