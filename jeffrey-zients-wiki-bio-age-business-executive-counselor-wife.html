Zients was born in a simple and normal middle-class household. He was also raised in Kensington, Maryland. His parents followed the Jewish religion. Although not much has come to the light about his parents, we have discovered that they both were working individuals. Because of security reasons and concerning their safety, the exact identities and names of his parents have been kept hidden and unrevealed to this day. Our team was also unable to find out what his parents used to do as well. <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/rockcms/2023-01/230122-jeff-zients-jm-1422-e5c626.jpg alt="Jeff Zients to be named Biden's next chief of staff, replacing Ron Klain" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Furthermore, He never revealed anything about the existence of his siblings. We are not very sure if Jeff had any siblings or if he grew up with his parents alone as a single child. Zients always speaks in the interviews that he is there for the people of America. He doesn’t see any need to disclose his family life, their identities, and any personal information about his life to the world. Also, being a political figure it may be a safety risk to put all the family members in the media limelight.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Zients_Education></span>Jeffrey Zients Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zients’s parents enrolled him at the St. Albans School and was a very good student academically. He used to constantly take part in debates and elocutions. Jeffrey was a very quiet and polite kind of child when he was in school and was very focused on his studies and academics. Then after years of studying there, he finally graduated from his school in the year 1984.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/199ff275-dc28-40ce-9330-1a7caefa42b7.jpg alt="Jeff Zients: the 'Mr Fix It' in charge of tackling the US Covid crisis | Financial Times" width=683 height=384 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After completing his prep school education, Jeffrey enrolled himself at Duke University, one of the best schools in the world. After three years of rigorous studying, he graduated there and earned a bachelor’s degree in political science degree.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Zients_Career></span>Jeffrey Zients Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Zients worked as a management consultant for Mercer Management Consulting after graduating from college. After two years, he was chosen to be the COO of DGB Enterprises. It was a holding company for the Advisory Board Company, Corporate Executive Board, and Atlantic Media Company. After getting good experience from working at several places, he founded Portfolio Logic LLC. It was an investment company that largely focused on healthcare and business services, and also served as its managing partner.</p><p>Then in 2018, Zients joined the board of directors of Facebook when the controversy of Cambridge Analytica took place. On the other hand, Zients also overlooked the Audit and Risk Oversight Committee while still serving on the Facebook board. Later, Zients became the CEO of the Wall Street investment company Cranemere. Reports say, that while working there he made a total of $1.6 million in salary and bonuses. However, Zients resigned from his role as Cranemere’s CEO in December 2020.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Zients_Appointed_by_Obama></span>Jeffrey Zients Appointed by Obama<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A very big shock came to everyone in the year 2009. It was Zients’s first time dealing with the political authorities. Zients was appointed by President Barack Obama as the Chief Performance Officer of the United States. He was also appointed the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget in 2009.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/11/us/jp-WEBSITE/jp-WEBSITE-articleLarge.jpg alt="Health Website Tests a Tycoon and Tinkerer - The New York Times" width=877 height=615 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Then from the year 2014 until 2017, Jeffrey served as the National Economic Council’s director and the president’s advisor for economic policy. The authorities all over America had really started like his way of work. He was also offered to serve as the President’s Management Advisory Board’s chair as well. Later, Zients was described as an envoy to the corporate community.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zients_Become_White_House_Chief_of_Staff></span>Zients Become White House Chief of Staff<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After Obama’s era got passed and Biden came to power, Zients was still just as much needed by the white house staff members. Hence, Zients served as co-chair of Joe Biden’s presidential transition in October 2020. He also worked as The COVID-19 response coordinator and president’s counselor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.dw.com/image/64483712_605.jpg alt="Joe Biden to select Jeff Zients as next chief of staff – DW – 01/23/2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, not everything always stays flowy. Zients came under severe pressure in July 2021 when he postponed the easing of travel restrictions between the US and Europe. Later, Zients also declared in March 2022 that he will step down from the Biden administration in April, and will be replaced by Dr. Ashish Jha. However, very recently, it was announced on January 22nd, 2023, that Zients would take over as White House Chief of Staff in February from Ron Klain. We wish all the very best to Zients and salute him for his glorious career.</p><p>Here is the full Wiki Bio of Jeffrey Zients, his Age, Business Executive, Counselor, Wife, White House Counselor, Political Figure, Public Figure, Career, Education, Profession, Nationality, Ethnicity, Birthplace, Birthday, Sex, Hometown, Parents, Net Worth, and Family.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeffrey_Zients_Information_Table></span>Jeffrey Zients Information Table<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table style=height:1024px width=428><tbody><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Name</span></td><td></td><td>Jeffrey Zients</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Nickname</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Gender</span></td><td></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Profession</span></td><td></td><td>Political Figure</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Height (approx.)</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Weight (approx.)</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Figure Measurements</span></td><td></td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Eye Colour</span></td><td></td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Hair Colour</span></td><td></td><td>Salt and Spice</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Date of Birth</span></td><td></td><td><span class=nowrap>November 12, 1966&nbsp;</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Age (as of 2022)</span></td><td></td><td><span class="noprint ForceAgeToShow">Age 56</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Birth Place</span></td><td></td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Zodiac sign/Sun sign</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Nationality</span></td><td></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Place</td><td></td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td></td><td>St. Albans School</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>College/University</span></td><td></td><td>Duke University</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Educational Qualification</span></td><td></td><td>Graduation</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Religion</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Ethnicity</span></td><td></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Caste</span></td><td></td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td>Address</td><td></td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Hobbies/Interests</span></td><td></td><td>Law, Business</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Marital Status</span></td><td></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Affairs/Boyfriends/Girlfriends</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Sexuality</span></td><td></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Parents</span></td><td></td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Siblings</span></td><td></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Husband/Wife/Spouse</span></td><td></td><td>Mary Menell</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Children</span></td><td></td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Net Worth</span></td><td></td><td><span style=font-weight:400>$ 200 Million</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/this-week-jeff-zients-01-rt-llr-210703_1625334108862_hpMain_1x1_992.jpg alt="'This Week' Transcript 7-4-21: Jeff Zients, Gov.
