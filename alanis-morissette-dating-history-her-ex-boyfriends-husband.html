While the <a href=#>Grammy Award</a> winner is known for her powerhouse vocals and bold lyrics, Alanis has also made headlines for a few past high-profile romances.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Perhaps one of her most infamous ex-boyfriends was&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Full House</i>&nbsp;alum</a>&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Dave Coulier</b></a>, who was rumored to have inspired her hit single, “You Oughta Know.” The former pair dated from 1992 to 1994 when Alanis was 18 years old and Dave was 33. One year after they broke up, the&nbsp;<i>Jagged Little Pill&nbsp;</i>artist released the song along with her album and received continuous acclaim for her daring lyrical choices.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In July 2022, Dave opened up on Sirius XM Faction Talk’s&nbsp;<i>Jim Norton & Sam Roberts</i>&nbsp;about the moment when he realized her album was about him.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I listened to the lyrics going, ‘Ooh, oh no. I can’t be this guy,’ the former&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Fuller House</i></a>&nbsp;actor said. “There was a lot of familiar stuff in there that her and I had talked about. Like [in ‘Right Through You’] ‘your shake is like a fish.’ I’d go, ‘Hey, dead fish me,’ and we’d do this dead fish handshake. And so I started listening to it and I thought, ‘Ooh, I think I may have really hurt this woman.’ And that was my first thought.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Despite the harsh lyrics of some of the album’s ballads, Dave insisted that he remembered Alanis as “funny … sweet … super intelligent and super talented.”&nbsp;He&nbsp;also revealed that he and Alanis “reconnected” years afterward, noting that she “couldn’t have been sweeter.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“She actually drove to Detroit with her guitar and sat with my sister playing songs and singing to my sister in the hospital,” the stand-up comedian revealed. “That’s the kind of human being she is. So I’ve never had anything bad to say about her. She’s lovely … And I said, ‘What do you want me to say when people ask me about this relationship?’ And she said, ‘You can say whatever you want.’ So, she was really sweet about it. She was kind.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The “Ironic” singer, however, has not revealed who the song is about despite Dave’s statements about it. By 2009, she found her soulmate in then-boyfriend, rapper&nbsp;<b>Mario “Souleye” Treadway</b>, and the two tied the knot in May 2010 at their Los Angeles home. The happy couple share children Onyx, Ever and Winter.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>From time to time, Alanis gives her fans a glimpse at her and her husband’s life together by sharing an update on Instagram for a holiday or their anniversary.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I love shapeshifting through life with you,” she captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> photo in May 2022, which featured the two at their wedding. “@souleye these last twelve years have been [emoji]. Dreams coming true and bootstraps up and a soft place to land [sic].”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><b>Scroll through the gallery to see Alanis’ complete dating history.&nbsp;</b></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao5qmmah6rrvRoqqsnaSpsm6wwK2gp59dnba0wM6rsGaglad6psSMm6aynqKesq%2Bw0mafrquSlrulew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
