In a word, no. But we’re still going to talk about it, because some people really want this to happen and they’re trying to force it to happen in the gossip-universe. It all started when an Aussie tabloid called Woman’s Day claimed that the reason Harry hasn’t “moved on” publicly from Cressida Bonas is because he’s trying to keep a new relationship with Emma hush-hush.</p><p>After numerous failed relationships, it looks like notorious bachelor Prince Harry has found love with gorgeous Harry Potter star Emma Watson. Woman’s Day can exclusively reveal the pair are having secret dates with each other and are getting to know each other quite well.</p><p>When Harry heard she had split from her British rugby player boyfriend Matthew Janney at the end of last year, he called on mutual friends to help him hook up with the actress. He then sent Emma a short email saying that he would “like to get to know her” and invited her out.</p><p>Although 12 other friends went along too to make Emma feel a little more comfortable, the pair hit it off!</p><p>“Harry didn’t want her to feel like she was put on the spot,” explains one insider. “A party also shows he’s fun and not stuffy. He’s smitten – and it’s more than Emma’s looks.”</p><p>The good news is, Emma has already met some of the family! She met Harry’s brother Prince William last year at a cancer charity event and has also met his dad Prince Charles.</p><p><a href=#>[From Woman’s Day]</a></p><p>Emma was the one to indirectly shoot this rumor down by tweeting this:</p><p>WORLD ♥ Remember that little talk we had about not believing everything written in the media?!</p><p>— Emma Watson (@EmWatson) <a href=#>February 22, 2015</a></p><p>She followed that up with this: “also….. marrying a Prince not a prerequisite for being a Princess” and <a href=#>linked to this clip</a> from A Little Princess in which “all little girls are princesses.”</p><p>Here’s the thing… I’ll all for setting Prince Harry up on imaginary dates with actresses. But you’ve got to understand his type. You’ve got to make it plausible. Harry is always going to go for Blake Lively type of woman, not the Emma Watson type. You feel me? He likes ‘em blonde with curves. He also likes ‘em a little bit naughty. As for Emma… I’m not sure she really has a type. College-educated sensitive boys, perhaps. And Harry doesn’t fit that description either. So, yeah… this isn’t happening. Frankly, we’re more likely to see Harry with someone like Cara Delevingne.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wenn21980530.jpg alt=wenn21980530 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wenn22139232.jpg alt=wenn22139232 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWljbIVye8CrnJidnaKuoMPAraqopo%2Blv6q6wp6WoZmip8agvdSinK2kqZSxosDIp56YqKKkr6Kuy7KWp6eklMawwb6grLKrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
