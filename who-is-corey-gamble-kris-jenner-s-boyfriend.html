Simpson during his trial. He was also the father of Kris’ first four children: Kourtney, Khloé, Kim, and Robert. Later on, as the family gained fame through their reality show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, Kris was frequently shown alongside her former spouse <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caitlyn Jenner</a> on screen. The couple divorced in 2014 after 22 years together, and shared custody of the youngest members of the Kardashian clan: Kendall and Kylie Jenner. In more recent times, Kris is often seen hand-in-hand with Corey Gamble, but who is he?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-kris-jenner-s-boyfriend data-injectable=false>Who is Kris Jenner’s boyfriend?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>Gamble was born on November 10, 1980, in Atlanta, Georgia. The 42-year-old met Kris when he was 33 years old, while Jenner was 58, resulting in a 25-year age gap between the two. Fortunately, this age difference doesn’t appear to hinder their genuine love, especially considering the couple is now approaching a decade together.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>The Kardashian matriarch crossed paths with Gamble by chance at the 40th birthday celebration of fashion designer Riccardo Tisci in Ibiza, Spain. At that time, Gamble was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Bieber</a>‘s tour manager, and Jenner was going through a divorce with her former spouse. The exact moment when Kris and Gamble officially became a couple is not definitively known, but it wasn’t long before tabloids were buzzing with news of Kris’ new partner shortly after her separation in 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-509642778-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Perhaps unknown to some, Gamble worked as a tour manager for Bieber right from the singer’s first debut, under the employment of entrepreneur <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scooter Braun</a>. Beyond his managerial roles, Gamble has also established a reputation as an entrepreneur involved in fashion and music. More recently, Corey introduced a new silk collection in collaboration with the high-end brand Dolce & Gabbana, receiving praise from Kris’ children on social media.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>It didn’t take long for Gamble’s name to become a subject of interest. However, despite his connection to the Kardashians, his name has largely remained shrouded in mystery due to his preference for privacy and his low-key demeanor. Nevertheless, the entrepreneur frequently makes on-camera appearances alongside the Kardashian family and has become firmly associated with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the famous multimillionaire clan</a>.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>At the moment, Gamble can be often seen walking hand-in-hand with Kris while on their numerous and varied European vacations, or alternatively, in his occasional cameo in The Kardashians.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmm5%2Bnsrp5xpqkm6SVYriztdJmoZ6mnpq%2FtHnBqLCfqpmau6V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
