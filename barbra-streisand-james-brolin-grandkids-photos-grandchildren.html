The former couple welcomed one son together, </span><a href=#><b>Jason Gould</b></a><span>, in 1966. Barbra and Elliott were officially divorced in 1971. She found love again with James soon after when they met through a mutual friend.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“​​My husband and I were set up on a blind date,” she recalled in a November 2016 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>W Magazine</span></i></a><span>. “I met him at a dinner and expected a bearded mountain-man type, and he had cut off all his hair and was clean-shaven. I asked him, ‘Who screwed up your hair?’ He later told me that’s when he fell in love with me. My fella likes to hear the truth, which is unusual.”</span></p><p><span>The Grammy winner and the </span><i><span>Westworld</span></i><span> alum got married in 1998. Barbra became a stepmom to James’ three children from previous relationships:</span><a href=#><b> Josh Brolin</b></a><span>, </span><b>Jess Brolin</b><span> and </span><b>Molly Elizabeth Brolin</b><span>. She could not contain her excitement when Josh revealed that he and his wife, </span><b>Kathryn Boyd</b><span>, were expecting <a href=#>their first child</a> together in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“[Barbra] is, like, in our face. She’s calling all the time, emailing all the time, she has name suggestions, we got her a bracelet that says ‘Grandma’ on it [and] she started crying,” the </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> actor said during a June 2018 appearance on </span><i><span>Good Morning America</span></i><span>. “She’s into it, man. Really, really into it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><a href=#>Westlyn</a> arrived in November 2018. She became a big sister when Josh and Kathryn welcomed their second child together, daughter Chapel, in 2020. The </span><i><span>Deadpool</span></i><span> star is also a father to son </span><b>Trevor Brolin</b><span> and daughter </span><b>Eden Brolin</b><span>, whom he welcomed during his previous marriage to </span><b>Alice Adair</b><span>. Barbra has spoken about spending time with her stepson’s <a href=#>two eldest children</a> in the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Our granddaughter came over the other day, Josh’s daughter. She’s 16 years old and it was the sweetest thing — she just wanted to spend time with us. I canceled all my appointments,” the Broadway legend told </span><a href=#><i><span>Parade</span></i></a><span> in August 2009. “I had a lawyer’s appointment and a business appointment, and I said, ‘I can’t make it today.’ It’s so much fun to be with her. That’s more important now. More important than business.”</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see the cutest photos of Barbra and James’ grandkids.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmKuaopZ6tMDRnqCsmZ6Zeqi%2BwKebpKGUqHqxtM6tpqxll6eur7DCoaClnKKau27DyK2fZqKRorK0ecGrpqWhnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
