He currently has three shows on Paramount and streamer Paramount+ — Yellowstone, 1883, and <a href=#>Mayor of Kingstown</a>. He also has multiple projects in development for ViacomCBS — 6666, <a href=#>Land Man</a>, The Tulsa King, and many more.</p><p id=par-3_37>With so much on Sheridan’s professional plate, there’s not a lot of talk about his personal life. But fans shouldn’t be surprised that the wildly successful screenwriter and director has a successful, supportive wife by his side.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Yellowstone’ creator Taylor Sheridan is married to a cowgirl</h2><p id=par-4_69>Sheridan’s wife is Nicole Muirbrook Sheridan, a woman who shares his love of the outdoors and the wild west. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wide Open Country</a>, Nicole is a self-proclaimed tomboy who grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. She also spent a good part of her childhood riding horses on her grandparents’ Wyoming ranch. When she was a teenager, Nicole was discovered by a modeling scout at a local mall.</p><p id=par-5_34>“I was very much a tomboy,” Nicole told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowgirl Magazine</a>. “I never wanted to brush my hair, I was always in the dirt. Just super tomboy. And I was like, I don’t know, maybe.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_56>She eventually said yes, and signed with the renowned NEXT modeling agency. This led to a successful modeling career walking the runway in Paris, Milan, Los Angeles, and Miami. Nicole also appeared on the covers of Vogue and Marie Claire, and she worked with major fashion brands. She did all of this by her early 20s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nicole Muirbrook Sheridan met her husband when she tried acting</h2><p id=par-7_42>In addition to modeling, Nicole tried to get into acting in Hollywood. She landed small roles on How I Met Your Mother and Dark Blue. She also appeared in the films The Human Contract and I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.</p><p id=par-8_32>At the same time, Sheridan was appearing on <a href=#>Sons of Anarchy</a> as Deputy Chief David Hale. To make ends meet, he coached other actors. And that’s how Sheridan met his wife Nicole.</p><p id=par-9_45>Right away, the two were inseparable. It wasn’t long before they moved in together and became parents to a son they named Gus. But times were tough financially due to Sheridan’s low pay, which led to him quitting Sons of Anarchy and becoming a screenwriter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The ‘Yellowstone’ creator’s decision to quit acting quickly paid off</h2><p id=par-10_59>Transitioning from actor to screenwriter might not seem like a financially lucrative move, and for most people it isn’t. But Sheridan immediately found his niche, and it quickly paid off. His first script was for the Emily Blunt-led thriller Sicario. He followed that up with&nbsp; <a href=#>Hell or High Water</a>, starring Jeff Bridges. And that earned Sheridan an Oscar nomination.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_44>“At the time it was like ‘let’s just make enough to pay a mortgage or rent or food.’&nbsp; We were literally starving,” Nicole revealed. “That’s when Taylor started writing, and two years later, we were at the Oscars … I still can’t believe it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They moved to Taylor Sheridan’s home state of Texas</h2><p id=par-12_44>Thanks to the success of his first two screenplays, Sheridan landed a deal with the Paramount Network to create Yellowstone. When that show became a hit, the Sheridans got out of Los Angeles and moved to Park City, Utah. But that didn’t last long.</p><p id=par-13_46>“We were living in Park City, and Taylor really didn’t like the snow,” Nicole recalled. “So, he rolled over one morning and said, ‘Honey, we’re getting the hell out of here,’ and I’m like ‘Where are we going?’&nbsp; ‘We’re going to go to Texas,’ he replied.”</p><p id=par-14_41>Due to the hectic schedule of Yellowstone, Nicole says that they bought their house in Texas before she actually saw it. But when she finally got the chance to fly down for the weekend, she fell in love with the place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-yellowstone-creator-and-his-wife-bought-their-own-ranch>The ‘Yellowstone’ creator and his wife bought their own ranch</h2><p id=par-15_45>Now, the Sheridan family lives in Weatherford, Texas, on the Bosque Ranch, which has over 600 acres along the Brazos River. They are raising dozens of horses that compete in reining and cutting sports, and the property is littered with farm animals and rescue pets.</p><p id=par-16_40>“I love Texas,” she says. “It took me a minute to figure it out, but I’ve made great friends.&nbsp;We have 12 dogs, some chickens, and cats because I love to rescue.&nbsp; It’s nice to have the space to do that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-17_49>While <a href=#>Taylor Sheridan</a> keeps busy with his numerous TV shows, Nicole has her own packed schedule living the cowgirl life she’s always dreamed of. In addition to raising her son, she trains horses, goes fishing, and serves on the board for the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.</p><p id=par-18_17>New episodes of 1883 drop Sundays on Paramount+.
