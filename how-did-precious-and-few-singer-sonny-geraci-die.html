The first scene opens with a view of retired Navy Master Chief Arturo Amador (Joe Renteria) getting dressed in his bathroom. He chooses a tie, freshens up his breath, and then feeds his dog, Sonny Lee.</p><p id=par-3_50>Unfortunately, Arturo isn’t going for a night out on the town. Instead, he sits in his car and dies by suicide. Before Arturo passes away from carbon monoxide poisoning, he plays the song “Precious and Few,” and kisses a picture of his deceased fiancée. “I’m coming home, baby,” he says to the picture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who wrote ‘Precious and Few?’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_88>“Precious and Few,” which was recorded in 1971, was written by Climax guitarist Walter D. Nims and produced by Larry Cox. The song was a big hit for Climax in 1972. It reached the No. 3 spot on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 6 on the U.S. Billboard Easy Listening chart. The song also reached No. 1 on the U.S. Cash Box Top 100 and U.S. Record World The Singles chart. Climax had just one other charting song, titled “Life and Breath,” <a href=#>reports</a> Vintage Vinyl News. The group disbanded in 1975.</p><p id=par-5_56>The first verse is about the love shared between two people. The words fit Arturo’s story well, as he is trying to “find his way back home” to his lover, just as the song says. Sadly, his way of coming home is a lot darker than what the song originally intended. Here are the lyrics of the first verse:</p><p>Precious and few are the moments we two can share</p><p>Quiet and blue, like the sky, I’m hung over you</p><p>And if I can’t find my way back home, it just wouldn’t be fair</p><p>‘Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share</p><p>Written by Walter D. Nims/ Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC/Source: <a href=#>Lyrics.com</a></p><h2>How did Sonny Geraci die?</h2><p id=par-6_85>The lead singer of “Precious and Few,” Sonny Geraci, passed away February 5, 2017, at the age of 69.
