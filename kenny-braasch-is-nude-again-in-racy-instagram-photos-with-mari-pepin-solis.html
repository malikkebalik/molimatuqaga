Things weren’t always smooth sailing for the pair. Kenny was involved in a love triangle with Mari and <a href=#>Demi Burnett</a> that culminated in cake being thrown in the fire. He also spent quite a bit of time in his birthday suit. However, now it seems like Kenny and Mari couldn’t be happier. Kenny recently got nude again, this time with Mari in a racy photoshoot that she posted on her Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kenny-Braasch-and-Mari-Pepin-Solis.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mari-pepin-and-kenny-braasch-got-engaged-on-bachelor-in-paradise>Mari Pepin and Kenny Braasch got engaged on ‘Bachelor in Paradise’</h2><p id=par-2_57>Kenny and Mari formed a bond on Bachelor in Paradise, but that doesn’t mean things were always smooth sailing. Demi began to pursue Kenny, even after Mari confided in her about her feelings for him. The tension came to a head when Demi made a birthday cake for Kenny, and <a href=#>Mari threw it in the fire</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_62>Despite all the drama, Mari and Kenny decided that they were meant to be together. Kenny proposed on Bachelor in Paradise and Mari accepted. “We did go through a lot of real-life relationship stuff and we were tested like no other couple in Paradise,” Kenny said during the proposal. Now the pair are happily sharing <a href=#>updates on their relationship via Instagram</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mari-and-kenny-posted-a-nude-photoshoot-to-instagram>Mari and Kenny posted a nude photoshoot to Instagram</h2><p id=par-4_43>Recently, Mari posted a NSFW&nbsp;photo shoot of her and Kenny on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “WARNING. DO NOT swipe if you’re uncomfy w nudity….But if ya don’t care… here’s a spicy shoot I did a while ago w my fiancé,” Mari wrote in her captain.</p><p id=par-5_36>The post featured five nude photos of the couple, though nothing too revealing was shown during the photo shoot. Mari commented an “FAQ” on her photos to address some questions she felt might be coming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_41>“Our bodies aren’t photoshopped and neither are his tattoos, I just covered most of them w my body,” she wrote. “Not wearing my ring because these were done shortly after filming and I didn’t have it yet! Anything else??? Lol”</p><p id=par-7_42>The photoshoot somewhat harkens back to Kenny constantly walking around naked in Bachelor in Paradise. However, some fans were skeptical that <a href=#>Kenny really was naked</a>. Regardless fans are excited to see Kenny and Mari flaunting their happy engagement on social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-are-the-bachelor-in-paradise-couple-getting-married>When are the ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ couple getting married?</h2><p id=par-8_61>Mari and Kenny have not yet moved in together following the end of Bachelor in Paradise. Mari still lives in Maryland, while Kenny resides in Chicago. Living in the same state seems like the most logical next step for the couple. The fact that the couple no longer has to keep their relationship a secret will certainly make things easier.</p><p id=par-9_47>“It’s been hard because we can’t go out and be a normal couple… Now that we actually are out in public, we can finally do that,” Mari told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Today</a>. “I’m really excited to just do normal couple things, go for a walk, go out to dinner.”</p><p id=par-10_44>The couple have other things to do before they set a date for the wedding. “We’re really just taking it one step at a time,” Kenny told ET. “Move to Chicago, live together… and then from there, we’ll probably start planning the other stuff.”</p><p id=par-11_19>However, the couple have agreed that their wedding will take place in Puerto Rico where Mari is from.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvoq%2FHnqOoql2eu268wKuYnaGjmnqssc2nsGaaopautK%2FHZqWunJVirqityKdkq5mTrnqqutKtmKCqkaJ6sbTOraasZZ2Wv6p5z56noqZdqLyttdJnn62lnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
