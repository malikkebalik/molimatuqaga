The cover is… ample. If you couldn’t figure out, the photoshoot was done by Terry Richardson. Gross. The Kardashians have a difficult relationship with Rolling Stone – RS once published <a href=#>a massive slam-piece</a> and everyone laughed, but as with so many Kardashian-related things, the Kardashians always get the last laugh. This RS cover profile of Kim is actually… nice. She talks about a lot of different stuff. Some highlights:</p><p><strong>Whether she’s a role model:</strong> “In a certain way, I would never say I think I’m a role model or anything like that, but you know I live my life the way that I live it and I just try to be a good person. And I don’t try to look to be a role model for people. I think it’s a lot of pressure. If they think of me that way I’m so honored and so appreciative and I do what I can to be one, I guess.”</p><p><strong>She once dated Michael Jackson’s nephew, TJ.</strong> At the time, her dad, Robert Kardashian, “explained to me that he’s had a lot of interracial friends, and it might not be the easiest relationship. He said I should prepare myself for people to say things to me....When I was in high school, I’d get magazines and see interracial couples and think, ‘They are so cute.’ I’ve always been attracted to a certain kind of look.”</p><p><strong>Her secret marriage to Damon Thomas at age 20.</strong> “I was very happy at home learning how to cook and clean and keep a house. I knew that was where I wanted to end up.”</p><p><strong>Finding Bruce Jenner cross-dressing when she was in her 20s:</strong> “I was shaking. I didn’t know if I’d just found out his deepest, darkest secret, and he was going to come after me.”</p><p><strong>Before she married Kanye, they talked about Bruce:</strong> “I wasn’t sure if Bruce was going to be comfortable walking me down the aisle. He had just had his trachea shaved, so I knew something was going on.” She was afraid of what West might think, but West calmed her concerns. “[Kanye] obviously moves to his own drum. He lives his life the way he wants, a really authentic life, and he was like, ‘If you can’t be authentic and you can’t live your life, what do you have?’”</p><p><strong>Living with her dad during the OJ Simpson trial: </strong>“It was surreal, with Johnnie Cochran and Robert Shapiro and all these guys having meetings at my dad’s house… I definitely took my dad’s side. We just always thought my dad was the smartest person in the world, and he really believed in his friend… It’s weird. I just try not to think about it.”</p><p><strong>She self-identifies as a feminist:</strong> “I’ve never really been one on labels, and I don’t like to push my view. If I feel something, it’s how I feel. I never say, ‘I feel this way, so you should feel that way.’ Not that there’s anything wrong with it, but I just am who I am. But, yeah. I think you would call me a feminist.”</p><p><strong>She’s never flashed her biscuit for the paparazzi:</strong> “I rarely wear underwear, but that never happened to me. I was never drinking....I think that saved me a lot.”</p><p><strong>What she thinks about her sex tape now:</strong> “I don’t really think about it. I thought about it for a long time. But when I get over something, I get over it.”</p><p><strong>On The Sock One:</strong> “It’s not that mysterious, what’s happening with Rob. He has gained weight. He feels uncomfortable being on the show, and that’s OK. Do I think he smokes weed, drinks beer, hangs out and plays video games with his friends all day long? Yes.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Rolling Stone]</a></p><p>I kind of enjoy how Kim is the tough-love sister about Rob. Khloe is the one who will smother Rob with love and Kourtney is too self-absorbed to care. But Kim is the only one saying to Rob, “Tough sh-t, get over it.” I also didn’t know that Kim was living with her dad during the OJ Simpson trial – she also says that OJ moved in with her dad briefly and he stayed in Khloe’s bedroom (when Khloe wasn’t living there, obviously). Isn’t that… weird to think about?</p><p>Her feminism answer bugs me because she’s trying so hard to not alienate the people who “hate” feminism. She could have just owned it and said, yeah, I’m a feminist. Big deal.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kim1.jpg alt=kim1 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Terry Richardson/Rolling Stone.<br></p><a href=#><img width=150 height=84 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kim1-150x84.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img width=110 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kim2-110x150.jpg alt sizes="(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWtlaYJ4e8qipJijkaexor%2FHopinl5Okw6a%2B0pipqKScnruoq9Ktpqedj56stbTIp6KYsZ%2BqrLi71KWbmJuRobmgucSYmJielaK2r7XSrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
