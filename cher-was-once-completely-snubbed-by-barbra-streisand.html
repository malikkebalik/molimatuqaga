The pair had a successful music career and took their act to television. In the program, she and Bono sang songs and performed comedy skits. It was a sleeper hit in its three seasons and was scheduled to return for a fourth in 1974. Before that could happen, Cher and Bono separated, resulting in the show’s cancellation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cher-and-Sonny-Bono.jpg><p id=par-3_83>In 1976, the now-divorced couple reunited for two more seasons of their variety show under the new title&nbsp;The Sonny and Cher Show. In between those two series, Cher hosted a variety show of her own program, simply titled&nbsp;Cher. It was a surprise success and ran for two seasons in 1975 and 1976 before she decided to reunite with her ex-husband for their second variety series. While it ran, the series featured guest stars like Elton John, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, and Bette Midler.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-once-told-a-story-about-why-she-d-never-met-barbra-streisand>She once told a story about why she’d never met Barbra Streisand</h2><p id=par-4_47>In her solo show, Cher would allow audience members to ask questions where she was surprisingly candid. She offered audience members information about her weight, dating life, and body measurements. At one point, someone in the audience asked <span><span>the</span></span> “Believe” singer if she’d ever worked with Streisand.</p><p id=par-5_19>“Have I ever worked with Barbra Streisand? No,” she said during the segment (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>). “I’ve never even met her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Barbra-Streisand.jpg><p id=par-6_28>She went on to explain that she did once have an opportunity to meet Streisand, but the&nbsp;Funny Girl&nbsp;star didn’t seem interested. In fact, Streisand offered a blunt snub.</p><p id=par-7_34>“We were almost introduced one night, and someone said, ‘Do you wanna meet Cher?’ and she said, ‘No,’” she explained, laughing. “So that’s about as close as I’m gonna get to her I guess.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-two-artists-have-since-met-each-other>The two artists have since met each other</h2><p id=par-8_29>Though Cher predicted that the two artists wouldn’t meet, they have since formed a relationship. In 2018, Cher explained that she was recently talking to Streisand about her career.</p><p id=par-9_55>“I was talking to Barbra Streisand one day, and she asked, ‘Why do you still sing?’ And I said, ‘Because there’s going to come a day when I can’t,’” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>. “No one will want to come and see me, and I won’t be able to sing the way I’m singing now.”</p><p id=par-10_27>The pair also united in early 2021 for a concert special called We The People. They headlined the concert, which celebrated the Inauguration of President Joe Biden.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqbHRZqqnrZKXsqV5wZqpm6qRYsC1vsSiqpqmlGO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
