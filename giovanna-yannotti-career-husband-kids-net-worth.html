The name of her parents is not known to the general media. Not only that but the slightest of an idea is also unavailable about the siblings in the family.</p><p>Being born in the states, the model belongs to American nationality and holds white ethnicity as her family belongs to the Mexican roots, some descent can still be found in her. Moreover, the zodiac sign falls under Aries.</p><h2>Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Giovanna was born in 1987, which makes her 32 years old as of now. She stands at the height of 5’8″ and weighs 62 kgs. The fair complexion, skin, and also every charming smile have made her a fan favourite more often than not. Yannotti’s vital body statistics stands at 36-26-36.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Roxanne Age, Height, Career, Husband, Net Worth, Wiki >></a></h4><p>Giovanna looks slim in physique and also owns an hourglass figure. To add up to the overall outlook, flawless black hair, and a pair of ever shining dark brown eyes are her signatures.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Giovanna was born in Pittsburgh and spent most of her childhood there with her family and siblings. Although there is no name of her family, we still feel that the diva was raised with great care and support. Freedom to choose a career has led her to be the girl for the camera at this point.</p><p>For the educational background, though, Yannotti attended the University of Pittsburgh. Due to a lack of enthusiasm in studies and more in modelling and acting, the black-haired lady left the research and joined the modelling department.</p><h2>Giovanna Yannotti Career</h2><p>Giovanna is an amazingly talented actress and a show-stopper if we talk in the field of modelling. But her husband’s fame tends to overhaul her’s mostly.</p><p>After dropping out of college, her modelling career started, and well some minor roles and movies came along her way. With tidbits of performances, the actress found no feet until 2009 when she starred in all famous The Twilight Saga: New Moon. This provided Yannotti with a much-needed leap.</p><p>In the following year, the brown-haired diva was part of an episode in Justified. Her stairs to success were taking small but affecting steps. Till this, there have been some good movies and series that the American lady has been part of. Some of them include My Bloody Valentine, Sorority Row, End Game, Death From Above, and TV specials. We feel there is more to come from her, and we will let you know in detail about that.</p><h2>Husband</h2><p>One of the many reasons to know this actress cum model is mainly due to her husband. Kurt Angle is the lucky man to hold her hand, and well, they look like an adorable couple together. Both of the lovebirds met in the year 2009 when they were shooting for a movie together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/giovanna-1376.jpg><p>There and then was the moment of truth and togetherness. Both of them got engaged in 2010, but the good news came in the year 2012 when they walked down the aisle on 20th July of the same year.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chloe East Bio, Age, Height, Movies, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Most of our readers might not know, but the marriage was scheduled to happen in 2011, but it got shifted due to the pregnancy. At this point, both of them are happy with where the relationship stands. To strengthen their relationship, they are blessed with three children.</p><p>On 22nd January 2011, <strong>Giuliana</strong> was born, and the next year on December 31, 2012, Yannotti gave birth to <strong>Sophia</strong>. There was no stopping in children as the third one came to the world on 5th November 2016 as <strong>Nikoletta</strong>. There is hardly any news of any rift, so we feel that this relationship is going for the ages.</p><h2>Giovanna Yannotti Net Worth</h2><p>Giovanna might be known as the wife of the famous wrestler, but man, she has made a career out of herself in the field of acting and modelling. As of 2019, the net worth of Giovanna is estimated to be <strong>$2 million</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Clem Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, IG, Wiki >></a></h4><p>All of this is the result of dedication to acting and modelling. But there is sadly nothing available on the annual income and also the assets owned. We feel something will pop out soon from the circuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57xqKmr5meo65uxcCnpaispJ56orPEZp%2BeoZedwW6vwKucnqpdncK0rsCnm2ajmZnAbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
