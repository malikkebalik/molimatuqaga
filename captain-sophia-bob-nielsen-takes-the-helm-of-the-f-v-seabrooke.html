  Bob made her Deadliest Catch debut in season 19, working with Captain Jake Anderson on the F/V Saga before striking out on her own on the F/V Victory, the boat she inherited from her late father, who died when she was 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I ended up putting in close to 40,000 pounds. But I blew up my big generator and I got in a collision,” she explained in the <a href=#>Deadliest Catch Season 20</a> premiere. “I’m in debt $200,000 right now. Which is why I’m trying to home in on my skipper skills and become a better captain.”</p><p id=par-5_22>Enter Greg. He knew Bob’s father and is willing to give his daughter a shot as a skipper-in-training on the 109-foot Seabrooke.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_50>“I met Sophia a few years ago,” he said. “I knew her dad. I had a lot of respect for him when he was alive, and even now. She came at us and wants to learn more, so we’re going to see what we can do to help her out.”</p><p id=par-7_15>Bob knows that her dad’s legacy was a huge help in landing her current position.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_21>“I think the only reason I had a leg up with Greg was he knew who my dad was,” she said.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-bob-in-over-her-head-on-deadliest-catch-season-20>Is Bob in over her head on ‘Deadliest Catch’ Season 20?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_27>Greg has taken Bob under his wing, but that decision doesn’t sit well with all of his crew, particularly his daughter Megan, a deckhand on the Seabrooke.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_42>“I had to earn this job,” Megan, who went to school with Bob, said. “I had to work for him for years and really prove myself. She didn’t have to do the same and she’s already up there. So, I don’t know.”</p><p id=par-11_9>“If she’s not ready, she’s not ready,” Megan added.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_9>Bob understands why Megan might be suspicious of her.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_24>“I would be definitely jealous if it was my dad up here teaching some other young girl how to drive the boat,” Bob admitted.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_20>“I’m super envious of the relationship she has with her father because that’s something I will never get,” she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bob-steps-up-in-the-deadliest-catch-season-premiere>Bob steps up in the ‘Deadliest Catch’ season premiere&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-15_51>While Bob still has plenty to learn when it comes to handling the Seabrooke, a tough situation in the premiere proved she could handle unexpected challenges. While working with the crab pots on deck, Megan slipped and dislocated her hip. Bob stepped up to help Megan, who was in serious pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_29>“I’m not even supposed to be out here,” Megan confessed to Bob. She’d injured her hip previously, and doctors told her she needed surgery. But she ignored their advice.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_13>“I basically just put a Band-Aid on and came out here,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_21>After consulting Google, Bob managed to force Megan’s hip back into its socket. But Megan’s future on Seabrooke is now uncertain.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-19_15>“I love my daughter, but I don’t know what to do about her,” Greg said.</p><p id=par-20_21>Meanwhile, Bob knows she will need to step up and show she has what it takes to lead the Seabrooke’s crew.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-21_16>“I get skittish because it’s not my boat, not my gear, not my crew,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-22_17>Greg was willing to take a chance on Bob. But he won’t be going easy on her.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-23_15>“If you can’t improve you won’t be sitting there long,” he said. “It’s that simple.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-24_18>Deadliest Catch Season 20 airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Discovery Channel.
