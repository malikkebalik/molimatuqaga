Christie then went off to the New York Knicks – again, he didn't get his time to shine. This was unfortunate, as he turned out to be one of the best defenders in the league. Once again Christie was traded, this time to Toronto Raptors in 1996. Christie's time with the Raptors was considerably longer than the Lakers and the Knicks. Christie's luck finally changed: he picked up his scoring and became a regular Raptors player.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354823 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Doug-Christie-1.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1494px) 100vw, 1494px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354823 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images for BET)</p><p>Christie eventually moved on to Sacramento Kings.

Within no time, Christie signed to Dallas Mavericks. However his time with the team was short-lived due to complications of his left ankle. His short stay with the Mavericks led to speculations of his early retirement. Christie made a comeback with, signing a ten-day contact with Los Angeles Clippers – but on the second day of the contact, he decided to part ways with the team, announcing his retirement from the game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6Otjp2mrp9dmLWztdKtoJ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
