He also revealed whether he was surprised when he heard about his brother’s big new job.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>“You know, I don’t tend to get too surprised by what happens with my brother,” he said. “There was a moment of like, ‘holy sh*t,’ but then, you know, he’s cut out for it. He’s built for it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Was Sean Gunn surprised when his brother James went to DC? <a href=#>#GuardiansoftheGalaxyVol3</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/G3QElsKbUh</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B8tEBnUS8I</a></p>— Variety (@Variety) <a href=#>April 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>Sean Gunn also praised his brother’s work ethic, saying, “He works harder than anyone I’ve ever known. He eats sleeps and drinks this stuff. He’s good at it and he loves telling stories. He just loves it.”</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Honestly, it must be pretty nice to have a brother who’s a huge director AND the co-head of DC, but Sean Gunn is no slouch and he definitely pulls his weight in the Guardians franchise. However, he may have spoiled a very important plot point regarding Rocket Raccoon’s fate in the movie.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>Gunn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">did an interview</a> with Empire where he explained that it was getting harder and harder to play the character. Oh, and he said the latest movie would be his “swan song” as Rocket. A lot of people are taking this to mean Rocket’s going to die, but since this is the last Guardians movie, it could just mean that the movies are done so he won’t play Rocket anymore.</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=113 data-injectable=false>No one wants Rocket to die! We’ll know for sure when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 hits theaters on May 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TApq3NZp6upp5iwKLF0maZq6eknbKzecmapJ6rXayutHnBrqClrF2pvG60xJqbZpyTZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
