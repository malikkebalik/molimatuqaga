They worked together one year ago, filming I Saw the Light. Soon after they worked together, Olsen’s engagement to Boyd Holbrook was over and her dalliance with Hiddles was seemingly “on.” Sir Dragonfly might have even been a homewrecker! Then, when it came time for Olsen and Hiddles to parlay the gossip about their relationship into buzz for their film, Olsen seemed to tap out. While they were in Toronto, Olsen <a href=#>told Refinery29 that NO, she wasn’t dating Tom</a>, etc. The true Hiddles fans side-eyed her for that one, but Tom didn’t really say anything about it either way. And now Star Magazine claims he was totally over Olsen’s game-playing so he dumped her and he’s probably knee-deep in strange in Hawaii as we speak.</p><p>Talk about playing too hard to get. While it seemed as though ‘I Saw the Light’s’ Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen were ready to go public with their new romance, insiders claim the actress had trouble committing to her costar once filming wrapped.</p><p>“Elizabeth’s so focused on her career,” reveals a pal. “She just wasn’t sure she could handle a serious relationship right now.”</p><p>Tired of trying to make sense of her mixed signals, Tom broke it off with Elizabeth before he left to film ‘Kong: Skull Island’ in Hawaii – not that he’s singing the blues.</p><p>“He seems determined to enjoy himself out here, partying late into the night with cast and crew,” says a source on set. “And no one can help but notice just how close he’s gotten to quite a few of the gorgeous girls working on the production.”</p><p>[From Star Magazine, print edition]</p><p>Hm. If Elizabeth Olsen was so focused on her career, didn’t she realize that a high-profile romance with Tom probably would have helped her career? I mean… it wouldn’t have hurt at all. Still, it’s good to hear that Tom wasn’t waiting by the phone for Lizzie. He’s already moved on! Apparently. If so, good for him. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if he was enjoying the company of some lovely girls on the production. I’ve been saying this for a while too: Brie Larson is a possibility. She’s working on Kong: Skull Island too, and she gives me an Elizabeth Olsen vibe as well, which might be his type.</p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty, Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW1obIZye9KtmKuXpKS6oLTInZulnaOpvK%2Brw66kqZ2UlLKttdmamZ6smJS8rb%2FEp5abnZakv6arx56WpZ2Wqaynu9GYqqStnKGsqr%2FLmqWdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
