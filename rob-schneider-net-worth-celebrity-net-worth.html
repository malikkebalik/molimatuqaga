He was raised in the nearby suburb of Pacifica, California, by his parents Pilar (née Monroe) and Marvin Schneider. His mother was a former kindergarten teacher and school board president, and his father was a real estate broker. He has an older brother, John, who is a producer. Schneider is of a mixed heritage background. His father is Jewish, his mother is Catholic, and his maternal grandmother was from the Philippines. He attended Terra Nova High School, and after graduating in 1982 he continued his education at San Francisco State University.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Schneider started performing stand-up comedy while still in high school, and would often perform as the opener for local San Francisco band Head On, a band managed by his older brother. Following high school, Schneider would continue to perform around the Bay Area in nightclubs like the Holy City Zoo and The Other Café. He would also guest star on local radio programs. Following his gig opening for comedian <a href=# title="Dennis Miller Net Worth">Dennis Miller</a> in 1987, Schneider was given a chance to appear on HBO's 13th Annual Young Comedians special, hosted by Miller. Thanks to the exposure he got from the HBO special, Schneider was then given the opportunity to work on the NBC late night sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live" (SNL) as a writer in 1988.</p><p>Schneider's tenure as a writer at "Saturday Night Live" did not last long. He quickly became part of the cast, moving up the ranks from featured player to full cast member. From 1990 to 1994, some of the characters he played include "Tiny <a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a>" and "Orgasm Guy", as well as the annoying office worker Richard Laymer "The Richmeister", "Carlo" from the Il Cantore Restaurant sketches, and "The Sensitive Naked Man".

Patricia's hometown is Monterrey, Mexico. Together, they have two daughters, born in 2012 and 2016.</p><p>For a long time in the school system of his hometown, Pacifica, California, there were no music education programs due to lack of funding. In 1996, Schneider founded the Rob Schneider Music Foundation, to bring music education back to Pacifica's elementary schools. The foundation paid for teacher salaries, and provided funds to cover the costs of musical instruments and other equipment.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2003, Rob paid $1.922 million for a home in San Marino, California.
