They are a list of rules he lives and works by. He often mentions his rules during conversations. In a 2014 interview with the late Larry King, Harmon spoke about the rules. When asked if he has a list of Gibbs rules that he keeps, he said he doesn’t.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_35>“I know there is a list, a big list,” said Harmon. “I know some of them.” When King asks Harmon which rule he remembers, he immediately mentions Gibbs Rule No. 9: “Always carry a knife.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-day-gibbs-rule-no-9-came-in-handy-on-ncis>The day Gibbs Rule No. 9 came in handy on ‘NCIS’</h2><p id=par-5_45>During NCIS Season 17, Gibbs becomes close to his neighbor, <a href=#>Phineas</a> (Jack Fisher). They formed such a close bond that Gibbs often looked after him when his mother was away. He helped him with homework and even allowed Phineas to assist with an NCIS investigation.</p><p id=par-6_65>During NCIS Season 17 Episode 11 (titled “In the Wind”), there’s a scene where Phineas is being taken to the airport against his will. When he goes through the airport security metal detector, the alarms go off. An agent scans him with the handheld paddle and he recovers a knife Phineas had in his sock. His quick thinking helped stop his kidnapper in his tracks.</p><p id=par-7_40>When Gibbs reunites with Phineas, he asks if the kidnapper hurt him. Phineas says, “He tried to, but I stopped him.” Gibbs asks what Phineas means, and he says, “Rule 9: always carry a knife.

This is the name Gibbs decides on.</p><p id=par-10_40>Rule 91 comes up again when Gibbs is on the phone with Bishop (<a href=#>Emily Wickersham</a>). She asks him to remind her what the rule is.

She volunteers to pitch in and help with research after Bishop is accused of leaking sensitive National Security Agency information.
