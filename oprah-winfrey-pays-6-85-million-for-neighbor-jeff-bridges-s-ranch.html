The talk show legend purchased a four-acre ranch from the actor for a reported price of about $6.85 million.</p><p>Oprah paid a little bit less than Bridges's original asking price, which was at a little under $8 million when the ranch was first listed for sale back in April of this year. And the new ranch is now the third such property she owns in the area, after buying "Promised Land" in 2001 for $50 million, and "Seamair Farm" in 2015 for $29 million.</p><p>As for this latest addition to Winrey's Montecito land holdings, the main house reportedly dates back to 1919, when it was built by Montecito area architect&nbsp;James Osborne Craig. But there are lots of other structures spread across the ranch's four acres, like a two-bedroom guest house, swimming pool, pool house, and a carriage house with stables for up to five horses. The house has five bedrooms, five and a half baths, and a mix of original historic touches and more up-to-date furnishings. As its official listing describes the house:</p><p><strong>"Stunning ocean and mountain views. Lavish grand hallway, soaring ceilings and gracious Living, Dining and Family rooms. Stone terraces overlook the natural gardens dotted with oaks and Italian cypress. Home features beautiful Master suite; 3 en-suite guest bedrooms, kitchen with eat-in breakfast room; home office; and private Tower study opens to a fabulous roof terrace with panoramic views."</strong></p><p>The house has a one-bedroom attached guest cottage as well as a home theater room and recording studio, and out back you'll find a lower garden area with sculptures, a fountain, and even a fruit orchard. The listing goes on:</p><p><strong>"This gracious estate reminiscent of the hilltop villages of Italy offers the utmost in privacy, charm and Old World elegance."</strong></p><p>And now it all belongs to Oprah. But you can take a look at the property in the video below from Elevated Horizon:</p><p></p><p><strong>***UPDATE!***</strong></p><p>A reader contacted us overnight suggesting that the above house might NOT be the one that Oprah just bought. We are digging into the feedback because this information conflicts with another reader tip we received last week.</p><p>As a precaution, this is the house that the reader thinks Oprah just bought:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGefpb%2BitIywoKeeoprGbrzAsqpmbl1tgm65yKWjoqeeYrOwvoynnKKfmJe8s3nJnp2fZZKntqWzxKyqZqqRo7Cpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
