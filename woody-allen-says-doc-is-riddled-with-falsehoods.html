"I've been subjected to every kind of doubt, every kind of scrutiny and every kind of humiliation," she adds, claiming her father "was able to just run amok".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The film also includes the claims that Allen had sexual relations with another of Mia Farrow's adopted children, Soon-Yi when she was a minor. Allen's wife, now 50, was 16 when she met the star, who is 35 years her senior.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It also implies that he might have successfully derailed two official investigations into the matter, neither of which resulted in any charges.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/10601/production/_117137076_gettyimages-524732112.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Dylan and Mia Farrow in 2016" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Dylan and Mia Farrow (pictured in 2016) both appear in the documentary</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The feature suggests that, until the #MeToo movement gathered pace in 2017, the Manhattan, Annie Hall and Midnight in Paris director continued to enjoy the support of the industry, as Mia Farrow became persona non grata in Hollywood.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Allen and Soon-Yi, who has previously publicly defended her husband, do not appear in the series themselves to give their side of the story. Extracts from Allen's 2020 autobiography, Apropos of Nothing, are read out in his stead.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Also notable by his absence is Moses Farrow, another of Allen and Farrow's adopted children, who has previously defended his father - arguing that Dylan was indeed brainwashed by her mother.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">Why has Woody Allen objected?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Allen and Soon-Yi released a <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">statement to The Hollywood Reporter,</a> claiming the series is a "shoddy hit piece".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"These documentarians had no interest in the truth," the statement read. "Instead, they spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"Woody and Soon-Yi were approached less than two months ago and given only a matter of days 'to respond'. Of course, they declined to do so."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/15421/production/_117137078_gettyimages-925292054.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Soon-Yi and Woody Allen in 2018" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Soon-Yi and Woody Allen (pictured in 2018) say the allegations are "categorically false"</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It continued: "As has been known for decades, these allegations are categorically false. Multiple agencies investigated them at the time and found that, whatever Dylan Farrow may have been led to believe, absolutely no abuse had ever taken place."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The statement said that the HBO network "has a standing production deal and business relationship with [Mia's son] Ronan Farrow" - who is a prominent supporter of his sister's claims and the #MeToo movement.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"While this shoddy hit piece may gain attention, it does not change the facts," the statement concluded.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">How have the directors responded?</h2><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One of the film's directors, Kirby Dick, said they intentionally focused on Dylan Farrow's account because "Woody's story is out there".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"All the facts and the deeper dive, the real investigation that [lead investigator] Amy Herdy led and accomplished has yet to be out there, and that's what this series is," <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">he told The Washington Post</a>. "It's really not about him."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"It's more about the systemic," added co-director Amy Ziering. "This film is about complicity, the power of celebrity, the power of spin, how we all are viral and will believe something that's repeated enough."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Dick believes that many of Allen's supporters will, after seeing the film, "either change their mind or examine things in a much different way".</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">What have critics said about the documentary?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/C6C3/production/_117138805_gettyimages-1154698192.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Woody Allen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">The four-part documentary series is airing on HBO in the US</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">The Independent's Rachel Brodsky</a> gave the documentary five stars, predicting it will effectively "sound the death knell" for the 85-year-old's career.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"What Allen v Farrow proves time and again, though, is that Allen's alleged behaviour towards Dylan, which is at times captured on video and is repeatedly described as 'intense' and 'intimate' by eyewitnesses, appeared to be highly consistent with abuse," she wrote.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"To actually get at the truth, Allen v Farrow might have benefited from the impossible: interviews with every last family member. Regardless, it's safe to say that whatever dwindling respect Allen has enjoyed in the last few years may be wiped away after Allen v Farrow."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"><a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Charles Bramsco in The Guardian</a> plumped for three stars only, calling it "a damning if bloated series".</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"In an effort to touch on everything, some sub-topics (separating the art from the artist for Woody fans, the scuttled release of his latest film A Rainy Day in New York) get addressed so glancingly, they'd be best omitted," he opined.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"But however overinflated, the series has a lucid sense of its central image: that of a family ripped in half, with the kids left to choose sides."</p><h4 class="sc-d8a1d567-2 dNWcPM">Allow Google YouTube content?</h4>This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.
