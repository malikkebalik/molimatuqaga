In honor of Blum, here’s a short look back at his life and career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mark-blum.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark Blum’s breakthrough role</h2><p id=par-3_33>On May 14, 1950, Blum was born in Newark, New Jersey. His first major role came in 1985. That year, he worked alongside rising stars Madonna and Patricia Arquette in <a href=#>Desperately Seeking Susan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_55>In Desperately Seeking Susan, Blum played an uptight guy who has a whirlwind romance with Madonna. The film helped cement Madonna’s image from that era – that of a vibrant, free-spirited woman who made killer outfits out of thriftstore clothes. Blum would cite his role in Desperately Seeking Susan as one of his <a href=#>career highlights</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2>Madonna mourned the passing of Mark Blum on her Instagram account.</figure><p id=par-5_49>Madonna has fond memories of her co-star. “This is really tragic and my heart goes out to him, his family and his loved ones. I remember him as funny warm, loving and professional when we made Desperately Seeking Susan in 1985!” Madonna encouraged fans to take the coronavirus seriously.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mark Blum’s other career highlights</h2><p id=par-6_49>He also appeared in&nbsp; a secondary role in another well-received 1980s comedy: 1987’s Crocodile Dundee. The film was a smash hit and helped to introduce American audiences to a distinctly Australian sense of humor. Crocodile Dundees’ success led to two sequels, neither of which was made with Blum’s involvement.</p><p id=par-7_58>In addition to his film appearances, Blum had a number of roles in television series. He acted in episodes of The Sopranos, Law & Order, NYPD Blue, Billions, and Mozart in the Jungle. More recently, he had a role in the hit Netflix thriller You. Even near the end of his life, Blum was still getting significant parts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/crocodile-dundee.jpg><p id=par-8_56>On the stage, Blum appeared in several plays by <a href=#>well-known authors</a>, Specifically, he played roles in Gore Vidal’s&nbsp;The Best Man, Neil Simon’s&nbsp;Lost in Yonkers,&nbsp;and Albert Innaurato’s&nbsp;Gus and Al. He would cite the latter role as another one of his career highlights. Because of his prominence, Blum’s death had a significant affect on the theater world.</p><p id=par-9_58>The Playwrights Horizons, an off-Broadway theater, responded to Blum’s death by tweeting “With love and heavy hearts, Playwrights Horizons pays tribute to Mark Blum, a dear longtime friend and a consummate artist who passed this week. Thank you, Mark, for all you brought to our theater, and to theaters and audiences across the world. We will miss you.”</p><p id=par-10_12><strong>Also see:</strong> <strong><a href=#>Orson Bean: Prolific Television Actor Dies in Tragic Car Accident</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTGsMGMmpqtp6JiuqK%2BymaZpa2dYrGqsdJmnaunnWKwsL7Op5ivoaKqwG6vzqanpaGTlsGqu82sZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
