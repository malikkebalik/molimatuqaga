Fans of the alt-folk singer and the actor from Normal People are wondering if they are engaged after the couple finally gave fans a glimpse into their relationship via social media after months of casual online courtship. Everything you need to know about Phoebe Bridgers and Paul Mescal’s relationship, from their cute Twitter meet-cute to their creative collaborations and possible engagement, is right here.</p><p>In May of 2020, Phoebe and Paul had their first recorded exchange on Twitter and almost two weeks later, they met virtually on Instagram Live. Paul appeared in Phoebe’s “Savior Complex” music video set for release on December 8, 2020, marking the pair’s first artistic collaboration. Phoebe and Paul went Instagram official on December 10, 2021, following a year of sporadic online and offline interactions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phoebe-Bridgers-and-Paul-Mescal-Relationship-1.jpg><p>Rumors of their engagement first surfaced in April 2022, but they really picked up steam after a November 6, 2022 article in The Guardian claimed they were engaged. Read the below section for their relationship updates.</p><h2><strong>When did Phoebe Bridgers and Paul Mescal Relationship Start?</strong></h2><p><strong>Phoebe and Paul began dating after casually flirting with each other online</strong> and discovering they had a mutual admiration for each other’s professional achievements. Phoebe tweeted on May 12, 2020, that she was “sad and horny” after watching Normal People, Paul’s 2020 <a href=# rel=noopener>Hulu</a> series. Phoebe retweeted Paul’s message, “Nooo doesn’t die your so talented aha,” after Paul tweeted, “I’m officially dead.”</p><p>But what makes this exchange even more endearing is that Phoebe was Paul’s top artist on <a href=# rel=noopener>Spotify</a> five months earlier, on December 16, 2019. I mean it ain’t the cheeriest of lists, he mused. Whether it was predestination, fate, or coincidence, they were always huge fans of each other’s work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phoebe-Bridgers-and-Paul-Mescal-Relationship-2.jpg><p><strong>Learn more about these stars’ personal lives in the following articles:</strong></p><h2>Best Moments of Phoebe Bridgers and Paul Mescal Relationship</h2><p><strong>Phoebe and Paul finally met in during an Instagram Live event</strong> that was hosted about two weeks after their initial Twitter exchange. Paul expressed his admiration for Phoebe and the pair talked about their respective careers for the full 23 minutes. It’s pretty public knowledge that I adore your music, he told her.</p><p>She said that his remark made her blush and that the last time she cried was when she saw his Normal People character, Connell, cry. Then he came clean and said he listened to her song “Funeral” on set to get into character. Some viewers remarked on the pair’s obvious chemistry during the brief chat and The Mirror later reported that Phoebe and Paul continued their conversation over drinks on Zoom after the Instagram Live had concluded.</p><h3>Phoebe Says Paul Is “Cute”</h3><p>Phoebe had previously admitted that she found Paul attractive. Phoebe mentioned that she had started watching Normal People during the pandemic and that “the cute boy” from the show Paul was following her on Instagram in an interview published on June 12, 2020.</p><p>She said, “When I saw, my heart did a little pitter-patter.” Even though the interview wasn’t released until three weeks after Instagram Live, the stage was set for a future online romance.</p><h3>The Two Had Dinner in Ireland</h3><p>In July 2020, Phoebe and Paul were allegedly seen together at the Lemon Leaf cafe in Kinsale, Ireland, suggesting that they had finally met in person. The cafe tweeted, “Fan-Tas-Tic day thanks to @mescal paul and @phoebe bridgers for calling to our cafe this morning for breakfast,” despite the fact that no photos of the two of them together were taken.</p><h3>Phoebe Posts for Paul’s Birthday</h3><p>Phoebe posted a sweet photo to her Instagram story of Paul holding a bunch of pizza boxes in honor of his 25th birthday. She wished the birthday boy, @paulmescal, a happy birthday with the caption “Happy birthday pizza boy @paulmescal” and added the caption “Mmmmmmm” alongside a red heart emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phoebe-Bridgers-and-Paul-Mescal-Relationship-3.jpg><h3>Phoebe and Paul made their Instagram debut.</h3><p>Phoebe and Paul confirmed their relationship to the public in December 2021 ending months of fan speculation. Phoebe shared a sweet photo of the couple holding each other while floating in the water without any accompanying text and it quickly went viral. While Phoebe looks blissfully at the camera and smiles. Paul is almost on the verge of planting a kiss on her head in the photo.</p><h3>Valentine’s Day, 2022 for the Beautiful Couple</h3><p>A few months later on the most romantic day of the year, Phoebe continued the Instagram romance by posting a heartfelt message to her boyfriend. The couple is seen smiling at each other while cuddling on a bed in this black and white snapshot.</p><h3>A Round of Engagement Rumors Began</h3><p>Rumors of an engagement began during Coachella 2022 after the couple had been publicly seen together for four months. Phoebe, who was performing at the festival, allegedly introduced Paul as her fiance to other attendees, according to a report. Neither Paul nor Phoebe addressed these rumors, so their veracity could not be determined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Phoebe-Bridgers-and-Paul-Mescal-Relationship-4.jpg><h3>Paul and Phoebe go to the Met Gala together</h3><p>While the speculation may have died down after Coachella, it did not end there. Paul was seen sporting a silver band on his ring finger when he and Phoebe attended the May 2022 Vogue Met Gala, which had the theme “In America: An Anthology of Fashion.” Fans were already wondering if Phoebe and Nick were getting married because of her ringless finger.</p><h3>Phoebe Performs a Song About Paul</h3><p>On June 1, 2022, Phoebe’s new music video for her song “Sidelines” which she co-wrote with her drummer Marshall Vore premiered online and viewers noticed a brief clip of Paul approximately three minutes into the video.</p><p>The love song, Phoebe revealed in a June 24, 2022 profile published in The Guardian was inspired in part by her relationship with Paul. Writing about her relationship with nothing but positive emotions as that is all she feels is challenging, she admitted cheerfully. But when you’re experiencing those emotions, it’s much simpler.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Phoebe Bridgers and Paul Mescal are engaged. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/T5PByhi5PE</a></p><p>— Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 6, 2022</a></p><h3>There is Renewed Talk of an Engagement</h3><p>After an interview with Paul, it was widely assumed that Paul and Phoebe were getting married.
