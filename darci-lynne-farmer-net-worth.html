Darci Lynne Farmer first achieved national recognition in 2016 when she appeared on the television variety series "Little Big Shots." She rose to greater fame the following year when she won the 12th season of "America's Got Talent." Since then, Lynne has made appearances on a number of other television programs, and has gone on many tours with her ventriloquy puppets. For winning America's Got Talent, she won $1 million and her own show in Las Vegas.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Darci Lynne Farmer was born on October 12, 2004 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Misty and Clarke. She has three brothers. As a child, Lynne loved to sing, but was too shy to perform in front of audiences. To encourage her to overcome this fear, her parents suggested that she participate in the 2014 International Cinderella Scholarship Program. In addition to being crowned International Mini Miss at the pageant, Lynne met young ventriloquist Laryssa Bonacquisti, who inspired her to try ventriloquy herself. After her parents bought her a puppet for her tenth birthday, Lynne entered the local Edmond's Got Talent competition and won first place. Shortly after this, she met ventriloquy coach <a href=# title="Gary Owen Net Worth">Gary Owen</a>, who became her coach and manager.

For her appearance, she performed the song "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart" with her puppet Katie. Later in the year, Lynne performed at the Vent Haven International Ventriloquists' ConVENTion, where she became the event's first-ever child ventriloquist to perform at an evening show. A year after her initial appearance on "Little Big Shots" in the US, Lynne appeared on the British version of the show performing the same song as before.</p><h2 id=8220america8217s-got-talent8221><strong>"America's Got Talent"</strong></h2><p>Lynne achieved her greatest fame yet in 2017 when she competed on the 12th season of the television competition series "America's Got Talent."

For her next performance, Lynne serenaded judge Mel B with her mouse puppet Oscar while performing "Who's Lovin' You." She then advanced to the semifinals, where she and puppet Edna Doorknocker sang "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman." In the competition final, Lynne performed "With a Little Help from My Friends" with puppets Oscar and Petunia. Finally, in the "AGT" finale episode, she performed "Anything You Can Do" alongside her idol <a href=# title="Terry Fator Net Worth">Terry Fator</a>.

In 2019, Lynne returned to "AGT" to compete on the spinoff series "America's Got Talent: The Champions."

However, Lynne came back as a wild card act en route to the final, and finished in second place behind magician <a href=# title="Shin Lim Net Worth">Shin Lim</a>.
