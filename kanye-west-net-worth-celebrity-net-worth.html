When Kanye was a multi-billionaire, he was one of the the three richest self-made black people in US history. Kanye gained widespread fame upon the release of his 2004 album The College Dropout. Today he is one of the most successful and awarded musicians on the planet with 24 Grammy wins out of 75 nominations. In recent years he has pivoted away from music towards the business world, earning at least $100 million per year from his various endeavors. The vast majority of his earnings have come from royalties and other earnings related to his Yeezy brand and Adidas partnership. But his outspoken views and controversy have cost him many sponsors and partnerships over the last few years.</p><p>Kanye owns the Yeezy apparel line outright 100%. During his time partnering with Adidas he earned a royalty on every dollar of revenue generated. The Yeezy brand generated $2 billion per year in revenue and $250 million in profit for Adidas. At the peak of his partnership with Adidas, the Yeezy brand was estimated to be worth a $4 â€“ $5 billion on its own.</p><p>In March 2021, a UBS valuation estimated that Yeezy adds $3-4 billion to Kanye's net worth bottom line. The same report estimated Kanye's former deal with The Gap previously added $1 billion to West's net worth.</p><p>When assessing Kanye West's net worth in mid-2021, we included the following assets and liabilities:</p><p><strong>Assets:</strong></p><ul><li>Real estate assets = $120 million</li><li>Music catalogue including G.O.O.D Music = $80 million</li><li>Yeezy.com website = $100 million</li><li>Value of Yeezy brand = $5 billion</li><li>Value of Gap partnership = $1 billion</li><li>Cash, equities and other assets = $400 million</li></ul><p>Total assets = $6.7 billion</p><p>Liabilities and other considerations = $100 million</p><p><strong><span>Net Worth = $6.6 billion</span></strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262674 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kanye-West.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 2563px) 100vw, 2563px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262674 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia. Following his parents' divorce when he was three, West moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. There, he began experimenting with music after meeting producer/DJ No I.D., who mentored him. He received a scholarship to attend the American Academy of Art in 1997, but transferred to Chicago State University to study English. Eventually, he dropped out of school at age 20 to pursue his music career.</p><p>After dropping out of college, West began making beats for local artists while he honed his own style. His first official production credits were for the debut album of Chicago rapper Grave, Down to Earth, in 1996. Other artists he produced for during this period include <a href=# title="Foxy Brown Net Worth">Foxy Brown</a>, Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie, and Harlem World.</p><h2 id=rise-fame-music-career><strong>Rise to Fame and Music Career</strong></h2><p>In 2000, West got his big break when he began to work as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, working with artists including <a href=# title="Ludacris Net Worth">Ludacris</a>, <a href=# title="Alicia Keys Net Worth">Alicia Keys</a>, and Janet Jackson.

In 2001, he managed to convince the head of Capitol Records to sign him to Roc-A-Fella Records after being denied a contract with Capitol Records.</p><p>After a serious car crash in October 2002, where he shattered his jaw, West was inspired and recorded the song Through the Wire with his jaw still wired shut. This song laid the foundations for his debut album The College Dropout, which was leaked months before its scheduled release date in August 2003. West used the time to remix, remaster, and edit it, postponing its release three times. The College Dropout was eventually released in February 2004 to widespread critical acclaim, earning him 10 Grammy Award nominations, and eventually certified triple platinum in the US.</p><p>As he began working on his second album, West invested two million dollars into the production, even hiring a live string orchestra. Late Registration was released in August 2005, selling over 2.3 million units in the United States by the end of the year. His subsequent albums include Graduation (2007), 808s & Heartbreak (2008), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), collaboration album with <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> Watch the Throne (2011), Yeezus (2013), The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), collaboration album with <a href=# title="Kid Cudi Net Worth">Kid Cudi</a> Kids See Ghosts (2018), Jesus is King (2019), and Donda (2021).</p><p>West released the album Yeezus in 2013. The album reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as on the US R&B and US Rap charts and in four other countries. His album The Life of Pablo was released in 2016 and reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart and #2 on the US Rap and US R&B charts. West's single "FourFiveSeconds" (with <a href=#>Rihanna</a> and <a href=# title="Paul McCartney Net Worth">Paul McCartney</a>) reached #1 on the US R&B chart. In 2017 he was nominated for six Grammy Awards. His next album, Ye was released in June 2018. Unfortunately, Ye was the first album in Kanye's career to not go platinum.</p><p>In addition to his own albums and releases, West has continued working as a producer and featuring artist for other musicians, including 6ix9ine, XXXTentacion, Lil Pump, <a href=# title="Chance the Rapper Net Worth">Chance the Rapper</a>, Kid Cudi, and <a href=# title="Teyana Taylor Net Worth">Teyana Taylor</a>.

Below is a rundown of his most notable real estate purchases and sales.</p><p>During their marriage, Kim/Kanye's primary residence was an expansive estate in the LA suburb of Hidden Hills, California. This estate consists of multiple connected parcels, the first of which were acquired in 2014 in two separate transactions for $23 million. The first iteration of their property featured a newly-built mansion on 4.5 acres. The couple proceeded to spend millions of dollars over several years customizing, re-arranging, and expanding the home. In 2019 they expanded their estate with two separate transactions for neighboring properties to create a conjoined 7.5-acre behemoth. A staggering $28.5 million has been spent on real estate transactions alone to create the Hidden Hills estate. Tens of millions more have been spent on renovations. The Hidden Hills estate's current assessed value is north of <strong>$60 million</strong>. In September 2021 Kim paid Kanye $23 million to officially transfer the property into her name. Roughly $3 million of that amount went to the home's interior contents.</p><p>In September 2021 Kanye paid <a href=#>$57.3 million for a beachfront home in Malibu</a>. The home, which was designed by Tadao Ando, was built in 2013 for a Wall Street tycoon named Richard Sachs. Sachs spent seven years gathering permits and completing the construction. The finished home is 4,000 square feet and is made of 1,200 tons of concrete, 200 tons of steel and 12 pylons driven 60 feet into the sand. Sachs put the home on the market in 2020 for $75 million. Kanye never moved into the home. He put it on the market in December 2023 for $53 million. According to the listing agent, buyers will need to be prepared to spend "several million dollars" to make the house livable after Kanye's construction projects which were never completed.
