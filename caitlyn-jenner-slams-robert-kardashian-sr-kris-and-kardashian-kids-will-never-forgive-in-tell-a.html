Simpson, even though he believed O.J. was guilty, because he wanted to get back at Kris and (then) Bruce for marrying so quickly after her divorce from Robert was finalized.</p><p>Of course, you’ll remember that one of the murder victims, Nicole Brown Simpson, was O.J.’s ex-wife and Kris’s best friend. While there was tension between Kris and Robert during Simpson’s trial, they eventually made amends. However, Caitlyn’s new book will no doubt <a rel=nofollow href=#>open old wounds,</a> though it is Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob that will be most hurt.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/jenner-3.jpg alt="Caitlyn Jenner Slams Robert Kardashian Sr. - Kris and Kardashian Kids Will Never Forgive In Tell All Book" width=500 height=399 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Robert Kardashian is an absolute hero to his children. In their eyes, their father could do no wrong, so they will no doubt be unhappy with their father basically being described as a man so jealous and angry at Kris that he would defend a man he believed to be guilty just to get back at his former spouse and their mother.</p><p>The break in Caitlyn’s relationship with her step-children can be traced back to April 2015 when Caitlyn did an interview with and appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair. In the article, the former Olympian lambasted her former spouse, insinuating that she was “mistreated” during their marriage. This accusation led to a blow-up between Caitlyn and Kim (which was of course was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians) with Kim telling Caitlyn, “You don’t have to bash us on your way up”.</p><p>Although it seemed like Caitlyn and Kim made up, her relationship with Khloe remains strained. On a recent episode of their reality show, the ladies had a heart-to-heart about the lack of communication between them and both gave the impression that they want to improve their relationship, but that could all change once Caitlyn’s book is published.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/jenner-4.jpg alt="Caitlyn Jenner Slams Robert Kardashian Sr. - Kris and Kardashian Kids Will Never Forgive In Tell All Book" width=500 height=498 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Considering the relationship <a rel=nofollow href=#>between Caitlyn and the Kardashians</a> is already fractured, a tell-all&nbsp;book spilling their family secrets certainly isn’t going to help mend fences. and if Caitlyn’s memoir turns out to be insulting to Kris or Robert, Caitlyn could very well lose all hope of reconciling with her former step-children.</p><p>Do you think that Caitlyn is crossing a line with her new book? &nbsp;Share your thoughts in the comments below and don’t forget to check CDL for <a rel=nofollow href=#>more Caitlyn Jenner news and updates.</a></p><p>Image Credit: Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaHBnk5a2tbjYp2SjnZ6jsrN50qWYpqtdp7yjsdGtZKSZopmutLTImqVmq6Jitq95056jpWWRoblurs6oomajop7Abq3NnWSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZqOZmcBuw8ilo2amlauys3nFqKmgoaaaeqmx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
