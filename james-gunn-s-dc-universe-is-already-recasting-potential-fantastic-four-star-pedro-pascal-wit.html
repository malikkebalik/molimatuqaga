Exactly where Sean Gunn — most known to superhero lovers as Kraglin in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy — will make his debut as Lord is unclear, but a cameo in Superman: Legacy isn’t being ruled out. Deadline claims that the character will be referenced in some form in the film, however, before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely appearing in future DC projects</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sean-gunn-as-Kraglin-in-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Vol.-3.jpg><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>It’s only been three years since Maxwell Lord was last on our screens, of course, as Pedro Pascal played the part in Wonder Woman 1984. Although the Patty Jenkins sequel was poorly received overall, and is doomed to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the final film for Gal Gadot’s heroine</a>, Pascal’s casting and portrayal of the somewhat sympathetic Lord was widely viewed as one of its highlights.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Seeing as certain actors from the defunct DCEU are expected to return in Gunn’s regime — including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a> and Xolo Maridueña — it was vaguely possible that Pascal could be invited back. Especially given his enormous popularity as a performer. However, clearly the actor is not part of Gunn’s plans. Although if that’s because he’s busy working with Marvel as Mr. Fantastic, who can say? Well, Kevin Feige, that’s who.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Fantastic Four and Superman: Legacy actually come out within just a few short months of each other, with Marvel’s reboot of the beloved comic book property that launched its universe releasing on May 6, 2025 and DC’s reboot of the beloved comic book property that launched its universe arriving on July 11, 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6qMHNp6pmnJNiwq%2B11Z6prJ1dnsBurcurnJqcqWK%2Fpq%2FArKuippdivbDAxKeropmcYrOiutOaqq2hk2KzsMHRZqqtmaJivaaw0ahkqZmjmK6tedaiq6FlkWK5sLrGZqueqp1iuqTBjK%2BcrZ2ilrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
