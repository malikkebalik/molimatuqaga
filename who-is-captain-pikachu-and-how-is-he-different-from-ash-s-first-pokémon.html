Pokémon&nbsp;Ultimate Journeys: The&nbsp;Series has been airing in the U.S. since December 2021 and will end in March 2023. Although the series will sing Ash and Pikachu’s swan song, it’s also laid the foundations for an epilogue series, Pocket Monster Mezase Pokémon Master&nbsp;(Aiming to be a Pokémon Master), a collection of 11 special episodes, began airing in January 2023 in Japan.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Liko and Roy will grace our screens on April 14, and there’s been fan theories aplenty as to who these mysterious protagonists are. It seems to be popular speculation that Liko is Ash’s daughter, which might seem a bit far-fetched, but Pokémon has always been full of surprises. Aside from Liko and Roy, however, a recent announcement introduces two fresh faces to the new animated series: Friede and Captain Pikachu. These characters are a Pokémon professor and partner Pokémon duo who will battle alongside Liko and Roy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=de dir=ltr>First look at Friede and his partner Pokémon, Captain Pikachu in the new animated ‘POKÉMON’ series. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QsLfha19yR</a></p>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href=#>February 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=880 data-injectable=true>From what we’ve seen of promotional material, the anime will feature the Pokémon known as Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly from the&nbsp;Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon&nbsp;Violet&nbsp;video games that inspired the series. As an added bonus, it will also feature the Legendary Pokémon Rayquaza in its Shiny form. Following the announcement of Friede and Captain Pikachu, life-long Pokéfans and newbies alike are wondering who Captain Pikachu is and how he differs from Ash’s Pikachu, whom we’ve come to know and love across the last two decades.</p><h2 id=h-how-is-captain-pikachu-different-to-ash-s-pikachu data-injectable=false>How is Captain Pikachu different to Ash’s Pikachu?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ashs-Pikachu.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Well, the main distinction is that they’re two entirely separate Pikachu. One belongs to Ash, the other to Friede. Although the Pikachu species all look alike (distinguishable by gender based on the shape of their tails), Friede’s partner can be spotted by his pilot’s hat, which he wears proudly.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>He’ll also have a different personality and skillset to Ash’s Pikachu, who went on to become Pokémon Champion with his best friend Ash. It seems that Captain Pikachu is a working Pokémon just as much as a battling one, likely assisting Friede in his day-to-day tasks.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Stay tuned for the all-new Pokémon series when it begins airing on April 14, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6pK3PrZiipl2ltqytwqGsZpmemXqpu9ZmoKxlmJp6pbXFn5yrnZ6peqe%2BzqZkmquYqHqntdGsq2aon6CyrrvNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
