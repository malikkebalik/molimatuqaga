However, she’s still very invested in promoting CBD products, which she insists “reshaped” her “mental self-care.”</p><h2>Critics came after Kristen Bell for using marijuana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kristen-Bell-2.jpg><p id=par-4_33>Plenty of celebrities from Willie Nelson to Lady Gaga admit to using marijuana to help manage stress, unwind, and avoid alcohol. But Bell faced tons of criticism for her pro-pot stance in 2018.</p><p id=par-5_55>“I like my vape pen quite a bit and I smoke around my husband. It doesn’t seem to bother him,” the Forgetting Sarah Marshall star said during a podcast interview, according to <a href=#>HuffPost</a>. “Weed rules. Once a week, if I am exhausted and we are about to sit down and watch 60 Minutes, why not?”</p><p id=par-6_48>And after she received backlash from getting real about marijuana use, she says she didn’t pay attention to any of it, <a href=#>Refinery29</a> reported. “I literally don’t even care. [Marijuana is] legal in California — so maybe take it up with California if you have a problem with it?”</p><h2>She cut back on marijuana due to having children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kristen-Bell-and-Dax-Shepard.jpg><p id=par-7_20>Though Bell still defends the benefits of marijuana, she did say she won’t get high in front of her kids.</p><p id=par-8_45>“Because I’m always around my children, I don’t have the opportunity to [use recreational marijuana]. But I will say sincerely if given the choice, I would certainly rather use marijuana in any form than have a shot of something. I’m just not an alcohol person.”</p><p id=par-9_25>Instead of regular weed, Bell prefers CBD products and even invested in one of her favorite companies to make the products more accessible to everyone.</p><h2>Kristen Bell unveiled the affordable CBD brand Happy Dance</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_41>Bell came across the Lord Jones line of CBD products and fell quickly in love. However, she recognized that many fans and followers weren’t able to justify the pricey products. So she approached them about making a more affordable product line.</p><p id=par-11_51>The mom of two recalled, “I said, ‘Listen, you guys make the best products. Can we work together to figure out how to make a product that is aligned with all of our values and that has an accessibility factor? I don’t want anyone sweating when they look at the receipt.’”</p><h2>She’s focused on self-care during the pandemic — with CBD</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kristen-Bell-3333.jpg><p id=par-12_37>A three product release of CBD Body Butter, CBD Coconut Melt, and CBD Bath Bombs is the result of that conversation. It’s all part of her mission to help everyone access self-care, even during a global pandemic.</p><p id=par-13_24>Bell said CBD helps her, “feel like a thermostat in the room is at the exact right temperature” and calms her racing thoughts.</p><p id=par-14_53>“My mental self-care has been reshaped because I realized during COVID that I have to give everyone, including myself, a lot more grace. You’re going to see everyone’s proclivities when you’re spending this much time together, so you gotta make time for the things that calm you down and make you feel good.”</p><p id=par-15_57>And that’s perfectly aligned with her goals. “My main goal in life is to promote happiness and reduce suffering,” she told Refinery29. “I felt a responsibility with my voice and platform to share good information with other people who might need it. Happy Dance is a mindset and a mantra that reminds you that you are important.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4s7XSrZynZZKaua15xLGnpZmZo8Buw8eyZKyglWK%2BtrXTZqysoZ6cerOxwqucmqyZpLuiuIymmKuhmqqur62Ma2SynZGnwG6txqhkoqVdlrm4rdisZJqqn6q7pXnMsmScoJmhsbOxzWefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
