Hugh Hefner and Crystal Harris got married last night at the Playboy Mansion in LA. Crystal came back to Hef a few months after she dumped him and broke off their engagement just a few days before they were supposed to be married the first time, in 2011. She came back and they got re-engaged and now, I suppose, everybody is happy. Sure. Okay.</p><p>Hugh Hefner and Crystal Harris are on their way to happily ever after! The Playboy founder, 86, and his model girlfriend, 26, tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on New Year’s Eve at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, a mansion source tells Us Weekly.</p><p>Originally announcing her engagement to Hefner in December 2010, Harris called off her first wedding in June 2011 just days before the ceremony.</p><p>One year later, Harris confirmed via Twitter that she had reconciled with her ex. The couple cemented their plans to walk down the aisle once more in early December when they obtained a marriage license in Beverly Hills and Harris proudly debuted her new engagement ring. (She auctioned off her first ring — worth an estimated $90,000! — at NYC auction house Christie’s in October 2011.)</p><p>Taking special care to keep her second ceremony private, Harris — who recently opened her own lingerie store, Femme Fatale, in Studio City, Calif. — says her renewed bond with Hefner is solid.</p><p>“When the wedding didn’t work out the first time, it was because of me. I needed to explore out there and take the time away [from Hef and the Mansion]. The time away really helped make me realize that where I’m meant to be is here with Hef,” Harris tells Us Weekly. “Our relationship is better than it ever has been before. I’m very happy and Hef’s very happy and we’re excited.”</p><p>Former Girls Next Door star Harris is the Playboy mogul’s third wife. He married Mildred Williams in 1949 and the couple had two children together — Christie and David — before calling it quits in 1959. Hefner married Kimberley Conrad, the mother of his sons Marston and Cooper, in 1989 and filed for divorce in 2009 after an 11 year separation. Previous girlfriends of Hefner’s include Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson, Bridget Marquardt and Brande Roderick.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>My sources – <a href=#>Crystal’s Twitter</a> and <a href=#>Hef’s Twitter</a> feeds – say that they definitely went through with it. Both Crystal and Hef tweeted photos after the wedding, and Crystal already changed her Twitter name to “Crystal Hefner”. Do you think she’ll start tweeting sh-t about #getthatmoney or #honeymoonbaby or #golddigger4eva? Anyway, congrats to the happy couple. I hope they served soup at the wedding reception!! GET HEF SOME SOUP.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hugh2.jpg alt title=hugh2 width=568 height=408 sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn5666877.jpg alt title=wenn5666877 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wenn5666987.jpg alt title=wenn5666987 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, Hugh’s Twitter.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma29ha35xe8eunqGXmJqzr7HRmJqrsaOprq2rx5qpq6GjlLSwwL6mmKuqmZqxoK3TmKuhnY%2BluaLFwaiwmKWRo8Cqu82YpqeXnq6ycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
