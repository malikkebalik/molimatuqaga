The ring, which is being auctioned through Goldin Auctions, is being sold by an anonymous seller. According to Rovell, the ring is an authorized replica that friends and family of players can purchase, and is nearly identical to the rings that the<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>players receive.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-245941 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-904652686.jpg alt width=900 height=613 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-245941 class=wp-caption-text>(Jim Rogash/Getty Images)</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ken Goldin of Goldin Auctions told Rovell that it is very out of the ordinary for any item related to Brady to become available for purchase. "This is the first Brady award that has ever come to market. He never lets things go, and nobody from his inner circle has ever given up something like this," said Goldin.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Rovell says that the only real difference between the rings given to the players and the replica ring that is up for auction is the amount of diamonds in each ring, and the size. The rings that were given to players contain 283 diamonds, while the replica ring has 260 diamonds. In addition, the replica ring is roughly 10 percent smaller than the rings players receive.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The ring is valued at $29,700. The auction will end on Feb. 17.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mpmWSp66lxYyarK2gn6e2u7HDZqquqJWneqO71qVkpaFdp7KxuMicmGaqmaO0bq3UnKuip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
