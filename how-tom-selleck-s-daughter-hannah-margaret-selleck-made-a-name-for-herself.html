She doesn’t compete on the screen for Emmys and Oscars; instead, she competes on horseback, and she has won multiple medals for such since choosing to go down this career path.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_17>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Blue Bloods’ Star, Tom Selleck Opens Up About Taking a Break From Fame After ‘Magnum P.I.’</a></p><h2>Hannah Margaret Selleck: The road becoming a champion horseback rider&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_50>Hannah never desired the glamour tied to a life in the spotlight, at least not in the Hollywood sense, as <a href=#>News.Amomama</a> notes. She began training on horseback at a young age. Selleck stayed in school, yet her free time was spent at the Foxfield Riding School in Westlake Village, California.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_47>Selleck began learning the tricks of the trade at Foxfield at 16 years old. However, she had already been grooming, riding, and spending time with horses for years; she loved spending time with animals, which helped her choose between ballet and horseback riding a few years prior.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_37>Hannah began winning medals pretty early on, and she took home medals at the 2008 North American Junior and Young Rider Championships. She also won medals the same year at the Platinum Performance / U.S. Equestrian Federation.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_54>Though she kept competing at the amateur level, and a career in horseback riding looked promising, she still chose to enroll in college (as opposed to skipping out on the four-year education). She studied at Loyola Marymount University, which led to a brief change of heart before she found herself back on the saddle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2>Hannah Margaret Selleck tried PR on for size&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_40>Hannah Margaret Selleck received a Communications degree while studying at Loyola Marymount. She then went on to accept an internship at a public relations firm in Beverly Hills, California. She was there for six months, before returning to her horses.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_28>After her internship, as News.Amomama explains, she went and worked for her horseback riding coach, becoming an assistant trainer to newbies looking to learn how to ride horses.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_32>Hannah Margaret Selleck — with a little bit of help from her Hollywood father — went on to establish a facility for breeding and grooming competition horses. The name: Descano Farm.</p><p id=par-11_53>Today, most of Hannah Margaret Selleck’s attention is on maintaining Descano Farm and running the business she and her father worked to develop.
