One of the first entrants is "Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon" by <a href=# title="Michael Lewis Net Worth">Michael Lewis</a>. Lewis recently appeared on the CBS TV newsmagazine "60 Minutes" to talk about the crazy real-life story.</p><p>One of the more interesting tidbits from his book and the interview is that Bankman-Fried paid NFL superstar <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> $55 million… for what amounted to about a week's work.</p><p>Granted, that's a week spread out across three years, but still not a bad deal for Brady. "He paid Tom Brady $55 million for 20 hours a year for three years," said Lewis, who was granted close access to Bankman-Fried during the final months of FTX. During the FTX glory days, Bankman-Fried had a penchant for spending large amounts of money on celebrity endorsements, spending big to get huge names on board, names like Brady, <a href=#>Steph Curry</a>, and even "Curb Your Enthusiasm" auteur <a href=#>Larry David</a> for one memorable Super Bowl commercial.</p><p>According to Michael Lewis, Steph Curry was paid $35 million to perform roughly the same amount of work as Tom Brady, while Larry David earned $10 million to star in one Super Bowl commercial for the now-defunct crypto company. That $10 million fee for Larry is on top of the $25 million FTX paid to produce the commercial, which also happened to feature a subtle cameo from Sam's father Joseph Bankman, who was apparently a huge Larry David fan.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-352765 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1461251531.jpg alt width=900 height=581 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-352765 class=wp-caption-text>Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images</p><p>When news of Bankman-Fried's alleged crimes and the implosion of FTX first reached Tom Brady, Lewis told "60 Minutes" the quarterback was initially "crushed" before his attitude evolved:</p><p><strong>"[Brady] really liked him and he really liked the hope that he brought…As time has gone by and he's ceased to get a really good explanation about what's happened, I think [Brady] is just like, 'He tricked me. I'm angry. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.'"</strong></p><p>Today many of the celebrities who endorsed FTX, including other big names like <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a> and Brady's ex-wife <a href=#>Gisele Bündchen</a>, are facing a class-action lawsuit from FTX investors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDDxGalqK9doLuww4yao6Wdl5qxrcWMoaawZZ2qsKl50pqkZpqRo7iurc1mnauhlZl6sa3InWStp51ir7Otw7JkrKyVpbVur9SrqbJlkaOxbrjAq6myZZSWw6qwjJ%2Bmq2WknbKqvoyfq7FllaOxsL7SnqSepqSofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
