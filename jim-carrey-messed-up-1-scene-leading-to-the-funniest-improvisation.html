The film is narrated by the legendary Anthony Hopkins and has a great cast led by Carrey. Other stars include Gossip Girl’s <a href=#>Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who</a>, The Good Fight’s Christine Baranski as Martha May, and Molly Shannon as Betty Lou. Those with a sharp eye will also notice the director’s daughter Bryce Dallas Howard, listed on <a href=#>IMDb</a> as “Surprised Who.”</p><p id=par-3_54>By all accounts, the film was a slam dunk. Indeed, <a href=#>How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a box office</a> smash when it was released. According to <a href=#>RadioX</a>, the film went for four weeks at number one. It grossed $260 million worldwide which made it the second-highest-grossing Christmas movie of all time (behind Home Alone).</p><p id=par-4_7>However, the reviews tell a different story.</p><p id=par-5_56>The 1966 animated film Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas boasts a 100% critic rating on <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a> and a 95% audience score. In comparison, Carrey’s movie has a 49% critic rating and a measly 56% audience rating. Critics and viewers alike cite a distaste for the film’s crude humor, adult themes, and dark moments.</p><p id=par-6_42>However, Illumination Studios’ 2018 animated remake, The Grinch, has a similar critic and viewer rating to Carrey’s How The Grinch Stole Christmas, yet is now the highest-grossing Christmas movie of all time (<a href=#>Radiox</a>). So take those ratings with a grain of salt.</p><h2>The funniest moment in ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas’ was Jim Carrey’s improv fail</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_64>Critics and viewers also seem to agree, however, on the best part of How the Grinch Stole Christmas: <a href=#>Carrey’s performance</a>. Embodying a live-action Grinch is no small feat. And Carrey’s gift for physical comedy certainly lends some magic and humor to the part. But there was one stunt that didn’t go as scripted — leading to one of the film’s most hilarious moments.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_81>In the film, there is a scene in which the Grinch is preparing to attend an event in Whoville. He begins to toil over what to wear and grabs a tablecloth, snapping it from the table without disturbing a single item as though he was a skilled magician. This was not what Carrey intended, however. So the actor improvised, running back to the table where he sends everything flying (including the table) in a truly Grinch-worthy fit (Ms. Mojo via <a href=#>YouTube</a>).</p><h2>Where to watch ‘How the Grinch Stole Christmas’ with Jim Carrey</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_46>For viewers looking to watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas this year, Carrey’s version is available to stream with a subscription to HBO Max or Hulu.
