Is there enough material for an <strong>Overlord season 5 after season 4</strong>? The anime series is based on Kugane Maruyama’s light novels of the same name. The show is being animated by Studio Madhouse. The series is about a teenager named Satoru who is tired of his life and spends his days playing an MMORPG game.</p><p>Satoru’s skeleton avatar, Ainz Ooal Gown, gets stuck in the game world and non-player characters (NPCs) come to life. Ainz decided to be the Overlord until he could find his friends and go back to the real world. Here’s what we know about the <strong>Overlord season 5</strong> And <a href=# rel=noopener>10 Most Anticipated Upcoming Netflix Series Fall In 2022.</a></p><h2>Is Overlord Season 5 Confirmed?</h2><p><strong>No official date has been set for season 5 of Overlord</strong>. Neither the production committee nor the studio has said for sure that Ainz’s story will continue in season 5. A movie based on Overlord is being made and it will take place after the events of season 4.</p><p>The story of the light novel series volumes 12 and 13 will be turned into a movie called “Holy Kingdom Arc.” When the demon emperor Jaldabaoth attacks the kingdom in “<a href=# rel=noopener>Holy Kingdom</a> Arc,” the kingdom has no choice but to work with Ainz Ooal Gown, the lord of death, to defeat the demon.</p><p>Update: On September 28, the official Twitter account for the anime version of Overlord said that the “Holy Kingdom” movie is being made. Soon, more details will be shared.</p><p lang=ja dir=ltr>💀╋━━<br>その時、何が起きていたのか――<br>━━━╋💀</p><p>劇場版「オーバーロード」聖王国編<br>現在制作進行中です！続報をお楽しみに！<a href=# rel=noopener>#overlord_anime</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#オーバーロード</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#オバロ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y5DYFpTLIh</a></p><p>— オーバーロード／TVアニメ公式 (@over_lord_anime) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 27, 2022</a></p><h2>Is There Enough Source Material For Season 5?</h2><p>The anime is based on the light novels, of which 16 volumes have come out so far. The author, Kugane Maruyama, wants to end the light novels in two volumes, so volume 18 will be the last one.</p><p><strong>The light novels Volumes 10, 11 and 14 were used to make Season 4 of Overlord.</strong> The movie will cover the Holy Kingdom Arc, which is found in <strong>volumes 12 and 13</strong>. This leaves us with only two volumes,<strong> 15 and 16,</strong> which isn’t enough for now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Overlord-Season-5-2.jpg><p>Volume 15 and most of volume 16 are about what’s going on inside Ainz’s head and what’s going on around him. Since these volumes have a lot of talking and not much action, it’s likely that a lot of the content will be left out of the anime. This means that there isn’t enough material to make a 13-episode season. A New Season Of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Crown is Coming on Netflix this November 2022</a>.</p><p>Also, <strong>volumes 15 (352 pages) and 16 (360 pages) are much shorter than volumes 12 (410 pages) and 13 (360 pages) (584 pages).</strong></p><h2>When Will Season 5 of Overlord Come out?</h2><p><strong>The Overlord season 5 has not yet been given a date</strong>. Since there isn’t enough source material, season 5 might not be animated for years. Next, we’ll guess when it’s likely that season 5 will come out.</p><p>Most likely, the production team is waiting for the author to finish volumes 17 and 18 before they can start animating season 5. Volume 17, on the other hand, is likely to come out next year. The Japanese version of Overlord 16 came out in<strong> July 2022</strong> and the English version will come out in <strong>November 2022</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Overlord-Season-5-1.jpg><p>The author, Maruyama, plans to release Vols. 17 and 18 close together. This means that by the end of 2024, there will be enough material for season 5.</p><p>Usually, it takes 18 months to 2 years to make a season of 13 episodes of anime (from animating to dubbing). Season 5 of Overlord is likely to come out in 2026, which is 4 years from now.</p><p><strong>Also, Read:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Rookie Season 5 Episode 2 New Release Date Declared</a></strong></p><h2>Overlord Season 5 Storylines</h2><p>In season 5, the story is mostly about the Elf kingdom. Ainz wants to take a break after the Kingdom was destroyed. We learned in Season 4 that Ainz wants Aura and Mare to get to know their kind, the Elves.</p><p>Ainz goes on vacation with the twins to the Kingdom of Elves. But the Slane Theocracy attacks the elf king because they are afraid that Ainz will join forces with the elves, making it harder for them to fight the Sorcerer Kingdom.</p><p>Overlord hasn’t been renewed for a fifth season because there isn’t enough material to adapt. Season 5 will likely come out in 2026. A movie sequel is being made right now, but no date has been set for its release.</p><p>Keep following our site <a class=ab-item href=# aria-haspopup=true>Venturejolt.com</a> for more updates.
