“I never sing unless I have to. I don’t sing around the house,” the 77-year-old revealed to Mirror. “Singing is like work to me, it’s professional. It’s something I do. It’s not cathartic — it’s the opposite. I don’t go around singing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I don’t sing around the house,” the 77-year-old revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>. “Singing is like work to me, it’s professional. It’s something I do. It’s not cathartic — it’s the opposite. I don’t go around singing. If I sang happy birthday at a birthday party I would sound lousy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Barbra-3.jpg><p>This is of course coming from a performer who is one of the few people who has the honor of being a EGOT — Barbra has won an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony</a> Award. The legend also holds the Billboard chart record as the female with most number-one albums. However, there are times where, even with all these accolades, she isn’t entirely sure of herself.</p><p>“I’m a paradox, I think. I’m very vulnerable and I also have a sense of who I am, and this teacher said to me that’s good,” the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Star Is Born</a> actress explained to the outlet. “You need the vulnerability to balance the part of me that’s secure. Every once in a while I get insecure, and think, ‘Do you think you can do that?’ You have to have self doubt. It’s what motivates you.”</p><p>While Barbra doesn’t like to sing for herself, she does feel comfortable in the studio. “I love recording, putting on the headphones and singing to the music I love. I love to sing in the studio, as you don’t have worry about how you look. It’s all about the music,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Barbra.jpg><p>When she isn’t wowing people with her incredible talent after decades in the industry, Barbra is spending time with her husband&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>James Brolin</strong></a>, who she has been married to since 1998. Before this relationship, the icon tied the knot with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Elliot Gould</strong></a> in 1963, parting ways in 1971. The pair had one son, Jason.</p><p>“When I felt guilty about leaving my first husband, I lost my voice,” Barbra revealed. “All of a sudden I found myself on stage and couldn’t hold a note and i started thinking about how I do this? I went to this wonderful teacher for one session and said ‘You don’t have to learn this, you do it naturally.’”</p><p>Barbra is all about singing for work, and she will be doing that again soon, as she is set to perform in some big venues — she will hit the Hyde Park stage in London on Sunday, July 7, and then sing at Madison Square Garden on August 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46bmKuaopZ6tMDRnqCsmZ6ZerOx1Z6YpatdqLavs8innmaho6PBbq%2FArZ%2BaqqSesG6yzqtkoZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
