Amouranth is one of the most well-known Twitch streamers ever, but she has not always been without controversy. In fact, during the course of her streaming career, Amouranth has been suspended from Twitch a staggering six times.</p><p>Over the years, Amouranth has had numerous Twitch bans; however, not all of them have been given for the same reasons. Amouranth has occasionally been banned from Twitch, but the reason is not always clear to supporters. The most recent Twitch ban for Amouranth was his sixth overall, and viewers are still baffled as to why the streamer was initially subjected to the restriction.</p><p>Though explanations for why Amouranth was banned from Twitch this time are still pending, they might not be that important. Barely a day after Amouranth was suspended, Twitch changed its mind and allowed her channel to reappear on the service.</p><p>Fans of the broadcaster will have to wait and see if Amouranth decides to provide an explanation for why her channel was banned this most recent time since Twitch is unlikely to remark on her most recent ban.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Amouranth-Has-Been-Removed-From-Twitchs-Ban-List.webp><p>Amouranth’s six bans and subsequent reinstatement may be seen by some Twitch viewers as evidence of bias on Twitch’s side <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">as per reports</a>. Twitch has come under fire for allegedly being more indulgent with its more well-known artists, which makes financial sense but may not be fair to smaller streamers.</p><p>But without knowing the specifics of why Amouranth was prohibited for a sixth time, it’s difficult to develop any sort of judgment on this most recent occurrence.</p><p>Amouranth is not the only well-known Twitch streamer who has lately received a ban. Top Twitch streamer Kai Cenat was recently banned from the website as well, leading to rumors that she would switch to the competing website Kick.</p><p>The existence of Kick might increase the pressure on Twitch to refrain from banning its best streamers because doing so might tempt them to join the competition.</p><p><strong>You may also refer to the article we’ve included below:</strong></p><p>One of the main issues with Twitch’s ban policy, which has received a lot of criticism, is its lack of transparency. Sometimes users get banned from Twitch without truly understanding what they did wrong, and Twitch’s sanctions sometimes seem inconsistent.</p><p>It will be interesting to observe how Twitch modifies its ban policies in the future and whether fans ever learn the real reason behind the most recent Amouranth suspension.</p><p>If you wanted to read out more articles like this then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdganxxhI6trqKsk516trrBmqVmmZ2kwrOtza2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
