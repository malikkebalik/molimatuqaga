All of the contestants were given nicknames representing a unique aspect of their personality. Pollard was dubbed "New York" given her home state and the fact the she had a self-proclaimed New York attitude. A volatile exchange near the end of season one between Pollard and Brooke "Pumkin" Thompson in which Pumkin spat on Pollard left Pollard vowing to seek revenge.
