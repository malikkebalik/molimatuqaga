A Broadway stage is supposed to be a safe place for the actors. Phones are secured in pouches for a reason. Don’t violate him like that and don’t contribute to that violation.

I wonder how <a href=#>#JesseWilliams</a> feels. To me this is a violation. He is starring in a play where he is nude. As a result attendees aren't allowed phones. Someone broke the rules and his crown jewels are available for all to see. He is an actor not a porn star. No consent given.</p>— LISA BENT (@IamLisaBent) <a href=#>May 10, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Thankfully, today isn’t a completely terrible one for Williams. He’s just been nominated for a Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play at the 2022 Tony Awards for Take Me Out, with the show itself scoring a nomination for Best Revival of a Play.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=false>Even so, it’s pretty gross to be sharing this footage. Sure, you could argue that an actor standing before an audience night after night is clearly comfortable showing their body off, though at least they’ve given consent and control over how they’re being perceived. Random strangers ogling your dick completely out of any artistic context is very different from that and extremely uncool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SzorrSZpmlmaOperW0yKuqrbFdqLyktcClZKadlJ6ubrzOrKusZZ%2BrsrN5yZ6qrJ1drLatuMiapKxlnqqxpnnLnpikZaOWxm6102aaqKajqba1wdOeqmaaopqupLSMqJ1mm5%2BjwKa602g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
